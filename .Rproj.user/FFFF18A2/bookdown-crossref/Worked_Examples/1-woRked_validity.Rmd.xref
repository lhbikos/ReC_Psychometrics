With convergent and discriminant validity in mind, interpret the validity coefficients; this should include an assessment about whether the correlation coefficients (at least two different pairings) are statistically significantly different from each other.
h3:with-at-least-three-variables-evaluate-the-degree-to-which-the-instrument-demonstrates-incremental-validity-this-should-involve-two-regression-equations-and-their-statistical-comparison With at least three variables, evaluate the degree to which the instrument demonstrates incremental validity (this should involve two regression equations and their statistical comparison)
