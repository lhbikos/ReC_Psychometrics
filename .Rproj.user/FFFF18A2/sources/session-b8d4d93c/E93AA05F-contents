For more information about the data used in this homeworked example, please refer to the description and codebook located at the end of the [introduction](https://lhbikos.github.io/ReCenterPsychStats/ReCintro.html#introduction-to-the-data-set-used-for-homeworked-examples) in first volume of ReCentering Psych Stats.

As a brief review, this data is part of an IRB-approved study, with consent to use in teaching demonstrations and to be made available to the general public via the open science framework. Hence, it is appropriate to use in this context.  You will notice there are student- and teacher- IDs. These numbers are not actual student and teacher IDs, rather they were further re-identified so that they could not be connected to actual people. 

Because this is an actual dataset, if you wish to work the problem along with me, you will need to download the [ReC.rds](https://github.com/lhbikos/ReC_Psychometrics/blob/main/Worked_Examples/ReC.rds) data file from the Worked_Examples folder in the ReC_Psychometrics project on the GitHub.

The course evaluation items can be divided into three subscales:

* **Valued by the student** includes the items: ValObjectives, IncrUnderstanding, IncrInterest
* **Traditional pedagogy** includes the items: ClearResponsibilities, EffectiveAnswers, Feedback, ClearOrganization, ClearPresentation
* **Socially responsive pedagogy** includes the items: InclusvClassrm, EquitableEval, MultPerspectives, DEIintegration

In this Homeworked Example I will conduct and compare single order, unidimensional and correlated traits CFA models. My hope is that the results will support my solution of three dimensions: valued-by-the-student, traditional pedagogy, socially responsive pedagogy. This is the first part of a larger two-part suggestion for practice. These steps will be repeated in the next lesson's homeworked example. While somewhat redundant, I am hopeful that the second set will provide a fairly complete set of code for someone who is analyzing their own data from the beginning.

### Prepare data for CFA (items only df, reverse-scored)

We an upload the data from the .rds file. The file should be in the same folder as the .rmd file. I've named the df object that holds the data "big."
````{r}
big <- readRDS("ReC.rds")
```

For the demonstration of CFA first order models, I will just pull in the items that I believe go onto the three factors.

```{r tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=70), message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
items <- big%>%
  dplyr::select (ValObjectives, IncrUnderstanding, IncrInterest, ClearResponsibilities, EffectiveAnswers, Feedback, ClearOrganization, ClearPresentation, MultPerspectives, InclusvClassrm, DEIintegration,EquitableEval)
```

Let's quickly check the structure. The variables should be numeric or integer.
```{r}
str(items)
```

### Specify and run a unidimensional model  

First we map the relations we want to analyze.

```{r}
uniD <- 'CourseEvals =~ ValObjectives + IncrUnderstanding + IncrInterest + ClearResponsibilities + EffectiveAnswers + Feedback + ClearOrganization + ClearPresentation + MultPerspectives + InclusvClassrm + DEIintegration + EquitableEval' 
```

We analyze the relations by naming that object in our *lavaan* code.
```{r}
uniDfit <- lavaan::cfa(uniD, data = items)
lavaan::summary(uniDfit, fit.measures=TRUE, standardized=TRUE, rsquare = TRUE)

```
Let's plot the results to see if the figure resembles what we intended to specify.
```{r}
semPlot::semPaths(uniDfit, layout = "tree", style = "lisrel", what = "col", whatLabels = "stand")
```
### Narrate adequacy of fit with $\chi ^{2}$, CFI, RMSEA, SRMR (write a mini-results section)

>**Model testing**. To evaluate the models we, we used confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) in the R package, lavaan (v.0-6.17) with maximum likelihood estimation. Our sample size was 267. We selected fit criteria for their capacity to assess different aspects of the statistical analysis. As is common among SEM researchers, we reported the Chi-square goodness of fit (χ2). This evaluates the discrepancy between the unrestricted sample matrix and the restricted covariance matrix. Although the associated *p*-value indicates adequate fit when the value is non-significant, it is widely recognized that a large sample size can result in a statistically significant *p* value (Byrne, 2016b). The comparative fit index (CFI) is an incremental index, comparing the hypothesized model at least .90 and perhaps higher than .95 (Kline, 2016). The root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) takes into account the error of approximation in the population and expresses it per degree of freedom. As such, the fit indicator considers the complexity of the model. Ideal values are equal to or less than .05, values less than .08 represent reasonable fit, and values between .08 and .10 represent mediocre fit. The standardized root mean residual is a standardized measure of the mean absolute covariance residual – the overall difference between the observed and predicted correlations. Values greater than .10 may indicate poor fit and inspection of residuals is then advised. Kline (2016) advised researchers to be cautious when using these criteria as strict cut-offs. Elements such as sample size and model complexity should be considered when evaluating fit.

>Our first model was unidimensional where each of the 12 items loaded onto a single factor representing overall course evaluations. The Chi-square index was statistically significant $(\chi^2(54)=344.97, p<.001)$ indicating likely misfit. The CFI value of .85 indicated poor fit. The RMSEA = .14 (90% CI [.13, .16]) suggested serious problems. The SRMR value of .07 was higher than .05, but was below the warning criteria of .10. The AIC and BIC values were 6124.13 and 6134.13, respectively, and will become useful in comparing subsequent models.

The *tidySEM* package has some useful tools to export the results to .csv files. This first set of code exports the fit indices.

```{r}
uniDfitStats <- tidySEM::table_fit(uniDfit)
uniDfit_paramEsts <- tidySEM::table_results(uniDfit, digits=3, columns = NULL)
#uniDfitStats
#uniDfit_paramEsts
```

We can write each of these to a .csv file that will be stored in the same folder as your .rmd file.
```{r}
write.csv(uniDfitStats, file = "uniDfitStats.csv")
write.csv(uniDfit_paramEsts, file = "uniDfit_paramEsts.csv")
```


### Specify and run a single-order model with correlated factors       

First we map the relations we want to analyze.
```{r}
corrF  <- 'TradPed =~ ClearResponsibilities + EffectiveAnswers + Feedback + ClearOrganization + ClearPresentation  
             Valued =~ ValObjectives + IncrUnderstanding + IncrInterest 
             SCRPed =~ MultPerspectives + InclusvClassrm + DEIintegration + EquitableEval

  TradPed~~Valued
  TradPed~~SCRPed
  Valued~~SCRPed
'
```
Next we run the analysis.
```{r}
corrF_fit <- lavaan::cfa(corrF, data = items)
lavaan::summary(corrF_fit, fit.measures=TRUE, standardized=TRUE, rsquare = TRUE)
```
Plotting the results. Does it look like what we intended to specify?
```{r}
semPlot::semPaths(corrF_fit, layout = "tree", style = "lisrel", what = "col", whatLabels = "stand")
```

### Narrate adequacy of fit with $\chi ^{2}$, CFI, RMSEA, SRMR (write a mini-results section)

>Our second model was a single-order, correlated traits model where each of the 12 items loaded onto one of four factors. Standardized pattern coefficients ranged between .74 and .85 on the TradPed factor, between .56 and .84 on the Valued factor, and between .57 and .85 on the SCRPed factor. The Chi-square index was statistically significant $(\chi^2(51) = 224.795, p < 0.001$ indicating some degree of misfit. The CFI value of .91 fell below the recommendation of .95. The RMSEA = .113 (90% CI [.098, .128]) was higher than recommended. The SRMR value of .061 remained below the warning criteria of .10. The AIC and BIC values were 6009.95 and 6021.20, respectively.


Code for saving the results as a .csv file.
```{r}
corrFitStats <- tidySEM::table_fit(corrF_fit)
corrF_paramEsts <- tidySEM::table_results(corrF_fit, digits=3, columns = NULL)
corrFCorrs <- tidySEM::table_cors(corrF_fit, digits=3)
#to see each of the tables, remove the hashtab
#corrFitStats
#corrF_paramEsts
#corrFCorrs
```

Next, I export them.
```{r}
write.csv(corrFitStats, file = "corrFitStats.csv")
write.csv(corrF_paramEsts, file = "corrF_paramEsts.csv")
write.csv(corrFCorrs, file = "corrFCorrs.csv")
```


### Compare model fit with $\chi ^{2}\Delta$, AIC, BIC

```{r}
lavaan::lavTestLRT(uniDfit, corrF_fit)
```

>The Chi-square difference test $(\chi^2(3) = 120.18, p < 0.001$ was statistically significant indicating that the two models were statistically significantly different. The AIC and BIC values of the the correlated factors model were the lowest. Thus, we conclude the first-order, correlated factors model is superior and acceptable for use in preliminary research and evaluation.

### APA style results with table(s) and figure

Because we have written mini-results throughout, we can assemble them into a full results section. Keep in mind that most CFA models will continue testing multidimensional models. Thus, the entire analysis continues in the next lesson and associated practice problem.
