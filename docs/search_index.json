Early drafts are released for the purpose teaching my classes and gaining formative feedback from a host of stakeholders. The document was last updated on 13 Apr 2024. Emerging volumes on other statistics are posted on the ReCentering Psych Stats page at my research team’s website. Screencasted Lecture Link To center a variable in regression means to set its value at zero and interpret all other values in relation to this reference point. Regarding race and gender, researchers often center male and White at zero. Further, it is typical that research vignettes in statistics textbooks are similarly seated in a White, Western (frequently U.S.), heteronormative, framework. The purpose of this project is to create a set of open educational resources (OER) appropriate for doctoral and post-doctoral training that contribute to a socially responsive pedagogy – that is, it contributes to justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion. Statistics training in doctoral programs are frequently taught with fee-for-use programs (e.g., SPSS/AMOS, SAS, MPlus) that may not be readily available to the post-doctoral professional. In recent years, there has been an increase and improvement in R packages (e.g., psych, lavaan) used for in analyses common to psychological research. Correspondingly, many graduate programs are transitioning to statistics training in R (free and open source). This is a challenge for post-doctoral psychologists who were trained with other software. This OER will offer statistics training with R and be freely available (specifically in a GitHub repository and posted through GitHub Pages) under a Creative Commons Attribution - Non Commercial - Share Alike license [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0]. Training models for doctoral programs in health service psychology are commonly scholar-practitioner, scientist-practitioner, or clinical-scientist. An emerging model, the scientist-practitioner-advocacy training model, incorporates social justice advocacy so that graduates are equipped to recognize and address the sociocultural context of oppression and unjust distribution of resources and opportunities (Mallinckrodt et al., 2014). In statistics textbooks, the use of research vignettes engages the learner around a tangible scenario for identifying independent variables, dependent variables, covariates, and potential mechanisms of change. Many students recall examples in Field’s (2012) popular statistics text: Viagra to teach one-way ANOVA, beer goggles for two-way ANOVA, and bushtucker for repeated measures. What if the research vignettes were more socially responsive? In this OER, research vignettes will be from recently published articles where: the author’s identity is from a group where scholarship is historically marginalized (e.g., BIPOC, LGBTQ+, LMIC[low-middle income countries]), the research is responsive to issues of justice, equity, inclusion, diversity, the lesson’s statistic is used in the article, and there is sufficient information in the article to simulate the data for the chapter example(s) and practice problem(s); or it is publicly available. In training for multicultural competence, the saying, “A fish doesn’t know that it’s wet” is often used to convey the notion that we are often unaware of our own cultural characteristics. In recent months and years, there has been an increased awakening to the institutional and systemic racism that our systems are perpetuating. Queuing from the water metaphor, I am hopeful that a text that is recentered in the ways I have described can contribute to changing the water in higher education and in the profession of psychology.

REFERENCES "],["acknowledgements.html", "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS", " ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS As a doctoral student at the University of Kansas (1992-1996), I learned that “a foreign language” was a graduation requirement. Please note that as one who studies the intersections of global, vocational, and sustainable psychology, I regret that I do not have language skills beyond English. This could have been met with credit from high school, but my rural, mid-Missouri high school did not offer such classes. This requirement would have typically been met with courses taken during an undergraduate program – but my non-teaching degree in the University of Missouri’s School of Education was exempt from this. The requirement could have also been met with a computer language (FORTRAN, C++) – but I did not have any of those either. There was a tiny footnote on my doctoral degree plan that indicated that a 2-credit course, “SPSS for Windows” would substitute for the language requirement. Given that it was taught by my one of my favorite professors, I readily signed up. As it turns out, Samuel B. Green, PhD, was using the course to draft chapters in the textbook (Green &amp; Salkind, 2017) that has been so helpful for so many. Unfortunately, Drs. Green (1947 - 2018) and Salkind (1947 - 2017) are no longer with us. I have worn out numerous versions of their text. Another favorite text of mine has been Dr. Barbara Byrne’s (2016), “Structural Equation Modeling with AMOS.” I loved the way she worked through each problem and paired it with a published journal article, so that the user could see how the statistical evaluation fit within the larger project/article. I took my tea-stained text with me to a workshop she taught at APA and was proud of the signature she added to it. Dr. Byrne created SEM texts for a number of statistical programs (e.g., LISREL, EQS, MPlus). As I was learning R, I wrote Dr. Byrne, asking if she had an edition teaching SEM/CFA with R. She promptly wrote back, saying that she did not have the bandwidth to learn a new statistics package. We lost Dr. Byrne in December 2020. I am so grateful to these role models for their contributions to my statistical training. I am also grateful for the doctoral students who have taken my courses and are continuing to provide input for how to improve the materials. The inspiration for training materials that re*center statistics and research methods came from the Academics for Black Survival and Wellness Initiative. This project, co-founded by Della V. Mosley, Ph.D., and Pearis L. Bellamy, M.S., made clear the necessity and urgency for change in higher education and the profession of psychology. At very practical levels, I am indebted to SPU’s Library, and more specifically, SPU’s Education, Technology, and Media Department. Assistant Dean for Instructional Design and Emerging Technologies, R. John Robertson, MSc, MCS, has offered unlimited consultation, support, and connection.

In support of that goal, I try to provide just enough conceptual information so that the researcher can select the appropriate statistic (i.e., distinguishing between when ANOVA is appropriate and when regression is appropriate) and assign variables to their proper role (e.g., covariate, moderator, mediator). This conceptual approach does include occasional, step-by-step, hand-calculations (only we calculate them arithmetically in R) to provide a visceral feeling of what is happening within the statistical algorithm that may be invisible to the researcher. Additionally, the conceptual review includes a review of the assumptions about the characteristics of the data and research design that are required for the statistic. Statistics can be daunting, so I have worked hard to establish a workflow through each analysis. When possible, I include a flowchart that is referenced frequently in each chapter and assists the the researcher keep track of their place in the many steps and choices that accompany even the simplest of analyses. As with many statistics texts, each chapter includes a research vignette. Somewhat unique to this resource is that the vignettes are selected from recently published articles. Each vignette is chosen with the intent to meet as many of the following criteria as possible: the statistic that is the focus of the chapter was properly used in the article, the author’s identity is from a group where scholarship is historically marginalized (e.g., BIPOC, LGBTQ+, LMIC [low middle income countries]), the research has a justice, equity, inclusion, diversity, and social responsivity focus and will contribute positively to a social justice pedagogy, and the data is available in a repository or there is sufficient information in the article to simulate the data for the chapter example(s) and practice problem(s). In each chapter we employ R packages that will efficiently calculate the statistic and the dashboard of metrics (e.g., effect sizes, confidence intervals) that are typically reported in psychological science. 1.2 Strategies for Accessing and Using this OER There are a number of ways you can access this resource. You may wish to try several strategies and then select which works best for you. I demonstrate these in the screencast that accompanies this chapter. Simply follow along in the .html formatted document that is available on via GitHug Pages, and then open a fresh .rmd file of your own, copying (or retyping) the script and running it Locate the original documents at the GitHub repository . You can open them to simply take note of the “behind the scenes” script copy/download individual documents that are of interest to you fork a copy of the entire project to your own GitHub site and further download it (in its entirety) to your personal workspace. The GitHub Desktop app makes this easy! Listen to the accompanying lectures (I think sound best when the speed is 1.75). The lectures are being recorded in Panopto and should include the closed captioning. Provide feedback to me! If you fork a copy to your own GitHub repository, you can open up an editing tool and mark up the document with your edits, start a discussion by leaving comments/questions, and then sending them back to me by committing and saving. I get an e-mail notiying me of this action. I can then review (accepting or rejecting) them and, if a discussion is appropriate, reply back to you. 1.3 If You are New to R R can be oveRwhelming. Jumping right into advanced statistics might not be the easiest way to start. However, in these chapters, I provide complete code for every step of the process, starting with uploading the data. To help explain what R script is doing, I sometimes write it in the chapter text; sometimes leave hastagged-comments in the chunks; and, particularly in the accompanying screencasted lectures, try to take time to narrate what the R script is doing. I’ve found that, somewhere on the internet, there’s almost always a solution to what I’m trying to do. I am frequently stuck and stumped and have spent hours searching the internet for even the tiniest of things. When you watch my videos, you may notice that in my R studio, there is a “scRiptuRe” file. I takes notes on the solutions and scripts here – using keywords that are meaningful to me so that when I need to repeat the task, I can hopefully search my own prior solutions and find a fix or a hint. 1.3.1 Base R The base program is free and is available here: https://www.r-project.org/ Because R is already on my machine (and because the instructions are sufficient), I will not walk through the instllation, but I will point out a few things. Follow the instructions for your operating system (Mac, Windows, Linux) The “cran” (I think “cranium”) is the Comprehensive R Archive Network. In order for R to run on your computer, you have to choose a location. Because proximity is somewhat related to processing speed, select one that is geographically “close to you.” You will see the results of this download on your desktop (or elsewhere if you chose to not have it appear there) but you won’t ever use R through this platform. 1.3.2 R Studio R Studio is the desktop application I work in R. It’s a separate download. Choose the free, desktop, option that is appropriate for your operating system: https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/ Upper right window: Includes several tabs; we frequently monitor the Environment: it lists the objects that are available to you (e.g., dataframes) Lower right window: has a number of helpful tabs. Files: Displays the file structure in your computer’s environment. Make it a practice to (a) organize your work in small folders and (b) navigating to that small folder that is holding your project when you are working on it. Packages: Lists the packages that have been installed. If you navigate to it, you can see if it is “on.” You can also access information about the package (e.g., available functions, examples of script used with the package) in this menu. This information opens in the Help window. Viewer and Plots are helpful, later, when we can simultaneously look at our output and still work on our script. Primary window R Studio runs in the background(in the console). Very occasionally, I can find useful troubleshooting information here. More commonly, I open my R Markdown document so that it takes the whole screen and I work directly, right here. R Markdown is the way that many analysts write script, conduct analyses, and even write up results. These are saved as .rmd files. In R Studio, open an R Markdown document through File/New File/R Markdown Specify the details of your document (title, author, desired ouput) In a separate step, SAVE this document (File/Save] into a NEW FILE FOLDER that will contain anything else you need for your project (e.g., the data). Packages are at the heart of working in R. Installing and activating packages require writing script. 1.3.3 R Hygiene Many initial problems in R can be solved with good R hygiene. Here are some suggestions for basic practices. It can be tempting to “skip this.” However, in the first few weeks of class, these are the solutions I am presenting to my students. 1.3.3.1 Everything is documented in the .rmd file Although others do it differently, everything is in my .rmd file. That is, for uploading data and opening packages I write the code in my .rmd file. Why? Because when I read about what I did hours or years later, I have a permanent record of very critical things like (a) where my data is located, (b) what version I was using, and (c) what package was associated with the functions. 1.3.3.2 File organization File organization is a critical key to this: Create a project file folder. Put the data file in it. Open an R Markdown file. Save it in the same file folder. When your data and .rmd files are in the same folder (not your desktop, but a shared folder), they can be connected. 1.3.3.3 Chunks The R Markdown document is an incredible tool for integrating text, tables, and analyses. This entire OER is written in R Markdown. A central feature of this is “chunks.” The easiest way to insert a chunk is to use the INSERT/R command at the top of this editor box. You can also insert a chunk with the keyboard shortcut: CTRL/ALT/i “Chunks” start and end with with those three tic marks and will show up in a shaded box, like this: #hashtags let me write comments to remind myself what I did #here I am simply demonstrating arithmetic (but I would normally be running code) 2021 - 1966 ## [1] 55 Each chunk must open and close. If one or more of your tic marks get deleted, your chunk won’t be read as such and your script will not run. The only thing in the chunks should be script for running R; you can hashtag-out script so it won’t run. Although unnecessary, you can add a brief title for the chunk in the opening row, after the “r.” These create something of a table of contents of all the chunks – making it easier to find what you did. You can access them in the “Chunks” tab at the bottom left of R Studio. If you wish to knit a document, you cannot have identical chunk titles. You can put almost anything you want in the space outside of tics. Syntax for simple formatting in the text areas (e.g,. using italics, making headings, bold, etc.) is found here: https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html 1.3.3.4 Packages As scientist-practitioners (and not coders), we will rely on packages to do our work for us. At first you may feel overwhelmed about the large number of packages that are available. Soon, though, you will become accustomed to the ones most applicable to our work (e.g., psych, tidyverse, lavaan, apaTables). Researchers treat packages differently. In these lectures, I list all the packages we will use in an opening chunk that asks R to check to see if the package is installed, and if not, installs it. if (!require(psych)) { install.packages(&quot;psych&quot;) } ## Loading required package: psych To make a package operable, you need to open it through the library. This process must be repeated each time you restart R. I don’t open the package (through the “library(package_name)”) command until it is time to use it. Especially for new users, I think it’s important to connect the functions with the specific packages. # install.packages (&#39;psych&#39;) library(psych) If you type in your own “install.packages” code, hashtag it out once it’s been installed. It is problematic to continue to re-run this code . 1.3.3.5 Knitting An incredible feature of R Markdown is its capacity to knit to HTML, powerpoint, or word. If you access the .rmd files for this OER, you can use annotate or revise them to suit your purposes. If you redistribute them, though, please honor the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License with a citation. 1.3.4 tRoubleshooting in R maRkdown Hiccups are normal. Here are some ideas that I have found useful in getting unstuck. In an R script, you must have everything in order – Every. Single. Time. All the packages have to be in your library and activated; if you restart R, you need to reload each package. If you open an .rmd file and want a boxplot, you cannot just scroll down to that script. You need to run any prerequisite script (like loading the package, importing data, putting the data in the global environment, etc.) Do you feel lost? clear your global environment (broom) and start at the top of the R script. Frequent, fresh starts are good. Your .rmd file and your data need to be stored in the same file folder. These should be separate for separate projects, no matter how small. Type any warnings you get into a search engine. Odds are, you’ll get some decent hints in a manner of seconds. Especially at first, these are common errors: The package isn’t loaded (if you restarted R, you need to reload your packages) The .rmd file has been saved yet, or isn’t saved in the same folder as the data Errors of punctuation or spelling Restart R (it’s quick – not like restarting your computer) If you receive an error indicating that a function isn’t working or recognized, and you have loaded the package, type the name of the package in front of the function with two colons (e.g., psych::describe(df). If multiple packages are loaded with functions that have the same name, R can get confused. 1.3.5 stRategies for success Engage with R, but don’t let it overwhelm you. The mechanical is also the conceptual. Especially when it is simpler, do try to retype the script into your own .rmd file and run it. Track down the errors you are making and fix them. If this stresses you out, move to simply copying the code into the .rmd file and running it. If you continue to have errors, you may have violated one of the best practices above (Is the package loaded? Are the data and .rmd files in the same place? Is all the prerequisite script run?). Still overwhelmed? Keep moving forward by downloading a copy of the .rmd file that accompanies any given chapter and just “run it along” with the lecture. Spend your mental power trying to understand what each piece does. Then select a practice problem that is appropriate for your next level of growth. Copy script that works elsewhere and replace it with your datafile, variables, etc. The leaRning curve is steep, but not impossible. Gladwell(2008) reminds us that it takes about 10,000 hours to get GREAT at something (2,000 to get reasonably competent). Practice. Practice. Practice. Updates to R, R Studio, and the packages are NECESSARY, but can also be problematic. It could very well be that updates cause programs/script to fail (e.g., “X has been deprecated for version X.XX”). Moreover, this very well could have happened between my distribution of these resources and your attempt to use it. My personal practice is to update R, R Studio, and the packages a week or two before each academic term. Embrace your downward dog. Also, walk away, then come back. 1.3.6 Resources for getting staRted R for Data Science: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/ R Cookbook: http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596809164.do R Markdown homepage with tutorials: https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html R has cheatsheets for everything, here’s one for R Markdown: https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf R Markdown Reference guide: https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf Using R Markdown for writing reproducible scientific papers: https://libscie.github.io/rmarkdown-workshop/handout.html LaTeX equation editor: https://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php REFERENCES "],["QuestCon.html", "Chapter 2 Questionnaire Construction: The Fundamentals 2.1 Navigating this Lesson 2.2 Components of the Questionnaire 2.3 What Improves (or Threatens) Response Rates and Bias? 2.4 Construct-specific guidance 2.5 Surveying in the Online Environment 2.6 In my Surveys 2.7 Practice Problems", " Chapter 2 Questionnaire Construction: The Fundamentals Screencasted Lecture Link The focus of this chapter is on the technical issues of constructing a survey. I found this lesson to be more of a struggle to prepare than I expected. Why? There is a great deal of lore about what increases response rates and participation. Yet, research over the years, has both supported, contradicted, or not addressed these claims. One example is where to include “sensitive items.” Historically, textbook authors have recommended that these should come last so that respondents would be engaged in the process and be more willing to complete the survey (Krathwohl, 2009; Rowley, 2014). Yet, research has shown that this has not held up in employee groups (Roberson &amp; Sundstrom, 1990) nor among members of the National Association of Social Workers (Robert G. Green et al., 2000). Given these contradictions, this lecture starts with the overall structure of a survey. The core of the lecture focuses on recent, evidence-based support for item-level decisions. I briefly discuss construct-specific guidance and discuss specific considerations for the on-line environment. I then close by addressing some of the decisions that I routinely make in survey construction and provide my rationale for why. Because this lesson occurs at the beginning of a text on psychometrics – this “skips over and around” reliability and validity. These important issues will be addressed in subsequent clessons. 2.1 Navigating this Lesson There is just under one hour of lecture. While the majority of R objects and data you will need are created within the R script that sources the chapter, there are a few resources that cannot be created from within the R framework. Additionally, sometimes links fail. All original materials are provided at the Github site that hosts the book. More detailed guidelines for ways to access all these materials are provided in the OER’s introduction 2.1.1 Learning Objectives Focusing on this week’s materials, make sure you can: Outline the overall structure/components of a questionnaire, Articulate test construction myths (e.g., location of sensitive items, “requirement” to have reverse scored items) and their evidence-based solutions (when they have them) List elements to consider when the questionnaire is administered online 2.1.2 Planning for Practice This is a two-part lesson on questionnaire construction. After the second lesson, a detailed suggestion for practice will be provided that lists criteria for creating and piloting a survey of your own. 2.1.3 Readings &amp; Resources In preparing this chapter, I drew heavily from the following resource(s). Other resources are cited (when possible, linked) in the text with complete citations in the reference list. Chyung, S. Y., Roberts, K., Swanson, I., &amp; Hankinson, A. (2017).

Performance Improvement, 57(5), 38–48. https://doi.org/10.1002/pfi.21763 Finding the Chyung et al. series was like finding a pot of gold! They provide empirical support for guiding choices about survey construction. And they are current! If you don’t have time to read them in detail, I recommend you scan them and archive them for future reference. 2.2 Components of the Questionnaire Let’s start by examining the components of a questionnaire and the general guidelines for their construction(Colton &amp; Covert, 2015; Pershing &amp; Pershing, 2001): Title reflect the content of the instrument be concisely worded be written in language easily understood by the respondents should not be offensive or off-putting should be formatted clearly at the top/beginning of the document Introductory Statement include a brief summary of the instrument’s purpose contain an appropriate statement concerning the confidentiality of the respondent’s information (informed consent) be motivating such that respondents are inspired/willing to complete the items specify the approximate amount of time required to complete the instrument Directions complete, unambiguous, concise written at a language level appropriate to the respondents tell the respondents how to return the instrument once they have completed it (surprisingly, in Qualtrics, this is also important; submission requires hitting that last little “–&gt;&gt;”) Items discussed throughout this textbook Closing Statement thank the participants for their participation remind participants that their information is valuable and perhaps remind about next steps or follow-up confidentiality Overall Structure/Look should be coherent with an easy-to-follow layout professional appearance not crowded, plenty of white space avoiding a “slick look” numbering and headings to provide a sense of progress breaks between every 4-6 questions (or shading alternate items) in a sense, inviting and “easy on the eye” Pershing and Pershing (2001) reviewed 50 reactionnaires that were used by training evaluators at a “prestigious medical school.” Their purpose was to determine the degree to which the survey design adhered to the recommendations. The results suggested that: 72% did not include an introductory statement; an additional 16% were “minimal” 78% had no closing statement 30% had no directions; another 54% of directions were “minimal” 8% were professional in appearance In summary, the formatting of the reactionnaires were not designed in a way that would maximize respondent engagement. In turn, we might expect this to threaten the psychometric reliability and validity. 2.3 What Improves (or Threatens) Response Rates and Bias? When we design survey instruments based on our own preference rather than research-based evidence, we may get less than optimal data. Chyung et al. (2018) reviewed the five steps (Schwarz &amp; Oyserman, 2001) that survey respondents engage when answering structured, closed-ended survey items. Interpreting the question. Retrieving information from their memory. Integrating the retrieved information with the item prompt. Selecting one of the given response options. Editing the answer for reasons of social desirability. Chyung and colleagues appear to be starting such a systematic review. What follows are their evidence based evaluations regarding some of the most common questions about questionnaire construction. 2.3.1 Should Likert-type scales include a midpoint? Likert-type scales, named after Rensis Likert, include a set of questions or statements that can be responded to with a consistent set of response options. The response options are frequently scaled with intensity options ranging from 2 to 11; four and five point “agreement” scales str shown below. There are many variants of response options (i.e., frequency, like me, degree of stressfulness). Regarding the issue of a midpoint (“neutral” or “neither disagree nor agree”), Chyung et al. (2017) reviewed the literature. Examining their article, we can see variants of Likert-style scaling for a scale of agreement. They look something like this: Type No midpoint (4 pt) Strongly Disagree Disagree skipped Agree Strongly Agree Midpoint (5 pt) Strongly Disagree Disagree Neither Disagree Nor Agree Agree Strongly Agree Chyung and colleagues quickly suggest that the question is not “Should I use a midpoint?” but rather “When should I use a midpoint?” The article is more detailed, but essentially, a midpoint is appropriate when: the measurement scale is interval (instead of ordinal; this is a good statistical property to have) the question content is such that the midpoint is a true midpoint and not a point for hedging or avoiding If a true midpoint is impossible, then consider adding an option such as “I don’t know” or “It depends.” If the “I don’t know” option is used, the researcher needs a plan for recoding the data as missing and having a plan for managing missingness 2.3.2 Should continuous rating scales be used in surveys? First, let’s consider the distinction between discrete, continuous, and numerical scales. Figure 4 in the Chyung, Swanson, Roberts, and Hankinson (2018) article illustrate the major differences and some variations. Discrete scales are Likert-type scales that range range between 2 and 11 discrete options. Classically, respondents pick words (e.g., pain rated as no pain, mild, moderate, severe, extreme, worst pain possible). Six-point discrete rating scales result in a collection of six ordered values. The measurement scale for discrete scales is ordinal. Ordinal scales should be analyzed with non-parametric statistical procedures, however parametric approaches can be used if the data are normally distributed and there is a mid-point. Continuous scales allow respondents to indicate a response anywhere within a given range – usually by marking a place on a horizontal line on a continuum of a minimum of 100 points. There are no discrete categories defined by words or numbers. Continuous scales result in precise numbers (e.g., 26 or 26.8 if the scale is 0 to 100). The measurement scale for continuous scales is interval. Interval scales can be evaluated with parametric statistics. Visual analog scales (VAS; aka graphic rating scales, GRS) are another variant of continuous rating scales if they allow the participants to make “anywhere on the line.” Some VAS scales have verbal descriptors to guide the marking; some have numbers (hence, numerical response scales). In Qualtrics there is a slider option that serves this function. Which is better? The mixed results are summarized in Chyung et al’s (2018) Table 1. With a focus on the types of research I encounter in my program, here is my take-away: Continuous scales provide better data (i.e., more precise/full information, more likely to be normally distributed, better reliability) for statistical analysis. Caveat: If the response scale on a Likert scale is increased to 11, there is a better chance to have normally distributed responses. Caveat: When “simple descriptives” are desired (e.g., histograms, frequency distributions) the discrete scale may be the best choice. Discrete and continuous options (including sliders) are easy to use, except in the case where respondents complete the surveys on mobile devices. Caveat: There has been more missing data with sliders (compared to radio buttons). Caveat: Respondents are more likely to change their responses on sliders. If this means there is greater accuracy or more careful responding, this is desirable. In both circumstances adding “don’t know,” “prefer not to respond,” or “not applicable” may improve the validity of the responses. Caveat: When using one of these response options, plan ahead for coding as missing and managing the missingness. 2.3.3 Should Likert-type response options use an ascending or descending order? Let’s first look at the difference between ascending and descending order (Chyung, Kennedy, et al., 2018): Type Ascending Strongly Disagree Disagree Neither Disagree Nor Agree Agree Strongly Agree Descending Strongly Agree Agree Neither Agree Nor Disagree Disagree Strongly Disagree In the consideration of the choice between ascending/descending, we are concerned with response-order effects. Let’s first examine these conceptually/theoretically. Recency effect is the tendency of survey respondents to select the options that they see at the end of the response-option list. This is expected when options are presented orally (e.g., during interviews, people tend to choose from the last-offered options). Primacy effect is the survey respondents’ tendency to select the options that are presented at the beginning of the response-option list. This is expected when options are presented visually. For example, people tend to choose among the first-presented categories in self-administered written survey questionnaires. Left-sided selection bias occurs when respondents read text from left-to-right and are more inclined to select options from the left. Satisficing theory occurs when individuals seek solutions that are “simply satisfactory” so as to minimize psychological costs. Thus, respondents may select the first option that seems “reasonable enough”, select the “I don’t know” response, or randomly select one of the options. Acquiesence bias is the tendency for respondents to agree with the statement provided—aka yea-saying bias (e.g., being polite). Closely related is social-desirability bias, the tendency for respondents to select among the options they think are more socially acceptable or desirable (instead of true responses). In surveys, this generally is selecting agree or strongly agree. Considering these response biases together, Chyung et al. suggest that when the response options are presented in descending order (Strongly agree, Agree, Neutral, Disagree, Strongly disagree), respondents would (theoretically) see a positive option immediately on the left side of the response scale and perceive it to be socially desirable and satisfactory. As a result, they may to select it without having to spend more time to choose a more accurate response. After reviewing 13 studies, Chyung et al. observed that many studies (paper and web based, with children and adults, in English and other language): Revealed response-order effects in self administered surveys, especially the primacy effect, associated with left-side selection bias, acquiescence bias, and satisficing. Rhowed more positive average scores from descending-ordered scales. Recommendations: Present response scales in ascending order. When a number line is used, lower and negative numbers should be on the left. When using descended order scales: keep respondents motivated to complete items accurately, present half items with descended-ordered scales and the other half with ascended-ordered scales, assign half of participants with descended-ordered scales; half with ascended-ordered scales, and present response options vertically rather than horizontally. 2.3.4 Should surveys include negatively worded items? In examining this question, Chyung et al. (Chyung, Swanson, et al., 2018) made a distinction between (see Table 1 in the article): Statement format with a consistent response scale (e.g., strongly disagree to strongly agree). Question format with variable response scales that are tailored to individual survey questions. A challenge with this format is the difficulty in calculating an average score of data obtained from multiple survey items. The advent of negatively-worded items began with Rensis Likert in 1932. He was an American social psychologist who, in attempt to mitigate acquiescence/yea-saying biases, recommended designing one half of survey items to be associated with agreement and the other half with disagreement. Although Likert recommended “straightforward statements,” incorporating negative words can become quickly complicated. Table 2 in the Chyung paper shows that there are four ways of wording survey statements: Reverse-coding, which is necessary when including negatively worded items in a scale, assumes that agreeing to a positively worded statement and disagreeing to its negatively worded counterpart are the same. Tables 3 and 4 in the Chyung et al., manuscript (2018) show how this assumption may be faulty. A review of the negatively-worded-item literature suggested the following: Scales with all positively worded items yielded greater accuracy when compared with all negatively worded items or mixed worded items. Scores on positively and negatively worded items are not the same (e.g., strongly disagreeing to a positively worded statement is different from strongly agreeing to a negatively worded statement) Positively worded items produce higher means than negatively worded items. This may be due to carelessness and fatigue in reading items, the cognitive processing of positive and negative items may be different. A method factor has shown itself where exploratory approaches to factor analysis have produced separate factors with the negatively worded (or otherwise ambiguous) items creating their own factor. This results in a threat to construct validity and reliability. Chyung, Barkin, and Ramsey (2018) noted that respondent performance declines approximately 12 minutes after starting a survey. It appears that respondents increasingly fail to notice negatively worded statements even when there are efforts to draw their attention to them via bolding, underlining, or capitalizing the negated element (e.g., not). Thus, when negatively worded items are used, they should probably be presented early in the protocol. Chyung et al (2018) also cautioned about a response set bias that can occur when using all positively worded items. They recommended making design choices that enhance bias-free and accurate responding based on the research design. For example, attributes to be measured in some constructs (e.g., depression, anxiety) are, themselves, negative and so a negatively worded item may be most clear and appropriate. The inclusion (and subsequent analysis) of negatively phrased items may help detect acquiesence bias. Table 5 in the Chyung et al (2018) manuscript provides some guidelines that are more nuanced when negative items must be included. For example, Ensure that negatively worded items are true polar opposites and symmetrical (so they can be analyzed with the positively worded items). Group negative items together (and forewarn/format so they are recognized as such). Administer the survey when respondents are not fatigued. Analyze the effect of the negatively worded items. 2.4 Construct-specific guidance Across disciplines and constructs, there may be localized guidance. One domain-specific example is self-efficacy. In this case, construct-specific guidance addresses both the (a) content of the items and (b) formatting of the scales. Regrading content, even though there are some general self-efficacy scales Bandura’s original definition suggests that scales and their items should be task specific (i.e., career decision-making self-efficacy, math self-efficacy). Further, Bandura (2006), recommended the following for self-efficacy scales: Phrase items as “can do” rather than “will do.” Maintain consistency with the self-efficacy construct definition (e.g., domain specific, a focus on capability rather than self-worth). Include items that reflect gradations of challenge. Ask individuals to rate their current (as opposed to future) operative capabilities. Use 100-point continuous scaling. 2.5 Surveying in the Online Environment Nearly a decade ago, a survey of human subjects review boards suggested that 94% of the IRB applications reviewed involved online or Web-based surveys (Buchanan &amp; Hvizdak, 2009). Thus, it is important to understand the online environment. A first set of considerations involve data security, identity, and permission (implicit and explicit). The IP address as well as longitude/latitude has been a contentious issue for a number of years (Buchanan &amp; Hvizdak, 2009). EU data protection laws consider IP addresses as personally identifiable data; in the U.S., IP addresses typically fall outside the definition of “personal information.” In Qualtrics, the default is to collect and download the IP address (the “anonymize response” option can prevent this data from being collected). On the one hand it is helpful to know geographically “from where” participants are responding; on the other, some consider its capture to be a violation of privacy. Relatedly, paradata and metadata are data such as typing speed, changed answers, response times, and time spent on the survey. For both geolocation and paradata/metadata, a strong consideration is fully informed consent (Schober &amp; Conrad, 2007). Is it ethical to capture this information without explicitly saying so? A best practice is to provide complete descriptions of what data is being collected and provide a rationale (in the IRB application, if not directly in the informed consent) for why it is necessary. Survey tools like Qualtrics have strong options for anonymizing data (i.e., permanently deleting identifying information). If this option is being used, this information should be included in the informed consent (and, perhaps, recruiting materials). The specific survey tool being used should be evaluated. Buchanan and Hvizdak (2009) argued that until each tool is vetted and its privacy policies and data security policies are understood, we cannot be certain how security, consent, and privacy are operationalized within the individual tools. For example, it is possible that tool creators could gather respondent data and repurpose it for their own marketing, for sale to other researchers, and so forth. Online and web-based protocols increase our reach geographically and cross-culturally. A first impression might be that the online environment increases access (Schober &amp; Conrad, 2007). We should probably think twice about this presumption. Consider the decades of psychological research based on White, college-educated, males. Does the online environment create another strata of privileged research with technology that may not be accessible in terms of both internet/technology as well as capacity/fluency with the tool? Additionally, does the way that the survey is promoted result in invitations that only occur within certain segments of the internet? If so, the results may not be representative. On the other hand, what are the risks of not adopting new technologies before everyone has them. Another consideration is cultural and language translation. These issues are addressed more completely in the lesson on invariance testing. When paper/pencil measures were administered in face-to-face settings (individually or in auditoriums of students) there was some degree of a standardized protocol. This is lost when surveys are administered online. Further, we cannot guarantee who is taking the survey. Increasingly, when surveys are offered through fee-based programs like mTurk and Prolific, bots have been trained to take the surveys and receive the incentive. Survey programs like Qualtrics now offer additional packages to help with security and bot-prevention. It is probably also wise to add attention-check items (e.g., “This is an attention check. Please answer ‘3’.”). Another option is to include a final question that asks the respondent to ensure the integrity of the response. An example last item might be, “To what degree is the statement below true of you: I read each question/item and provided answers that were true for me.” The scaling for this item was a 100 point slider with “Untrue,” “Neither true or untrue,” and “True”. When respondents are remote, what happens if they have a negative reaction to the survey? In a face-to-face context, debriefings can occur and referrals can be made. IRB committees are likely to consider the degree to which surveys may be upsetting and require resources for referral and assistance in the case of an adverse event. Security of test items might also be concerning. It is inappropriate to use proprietary items without the permission of its author. If the security of items is important (e.g., SAT/GRE, intelligence test items, inkblots) because they are central to administration, how can they be protected in the virtual environment? Consequently, when students in our programs write doctoral dissertations they are to include the following in their Method section. Describe how informed consent will be obtained in the online environment. Describe the level of identification that is collected. If the claim of “anonymous” or “de-identified” indicate whether/not this includes capturing the IP address; some researchers believe that capturing a computer’s IP address threatens anonymity. Describe the steps to be taken to ensure that respondents met the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the study. Anticipate and describe how the online (e.g., uncontrolled, public, distractions) setting might affect responses. Particularly if the survey contained sensitive materials, describe how respondents might access resources for debriefing or referral. Identify the permissions (from original authors or copyright holders) granted to reformat and post (on the internet) existing surveys. If items are considered to be secure (e.g., those on the MMPI or WAIS), identify steps taken to protect them. 2.6 In my Surveys Because there isn’t empirical data on every decision that we make in survey construction, I thought it might be useful for me to address some of the decisions that I find myself making in the online surveys I use in my own research. 2.6.1 Demographics and Background Information A core value that I hope to reflect in the ReCentering Psych Stats series is to promote socially and culturally responsive research. Correspondingly, the information we collect from participants should ensure that they feel that their identities are authentically reflected in the survey. Naively, when I first considered how to capture race/ethnicity in my surveys, I looked to the categories used in the U.S. Census. Immediately, I learned that this is problematic. Rather than elaborating here, I invite you to take a listen to NPR’s Code Switch podcast. Two of the episodes review how the assessment of race and ethnicity has evolved and explain why it is problematic: Census Watch 2020 and The U.S. Census and Our Sense of Us. As made clear in the Code Switch podcasts, the assessment of race and ethnicity in the U.S. Census erases people when their identities are not included. My last few surveys have captured race/ethnicity data differently. Each time, I engage in several practices that (I hope) will continue to shape the item in a socially and culturally responsive way. Systematically, I: conduct a quick internet search to see if there is an emerging best practice (even though I may have also searched weeks or months prior), consider who the intended research population is in relationship to the topic of investigation, look to recently published, similar, research to see what other researchers are doing, and ask for a colleagial, formative review from individuals who hold marginalized identities, whose data will be requested in the survey. When I engage in research, I try to balance the need to quantify (with discrete categories) who is participating in the survey and inviting respondents to state (in their own words) their identity. This is consistent with my view that variables like race, ethnicity, and gender identity are socially constructed. In addition to this particular worldview, Parent (2013) has suggested that the worst possible kind of missing data pattern (MNAR – missing not at random) may be caused when items are unanswerable to particular person. Therefore, it is essential that all individuals recognize themselves in the items that assess demographic variables. A recent survey of mine was directed toward community members (including students, alumni, staff, faculty) of my predominantly White, liberal arts, Christian institution. After reviewing recently published research articles and consulting with a handful of individuals, I chose to include the following categories – each with a text write-in box so that individuals could select the category(ies) that fit best and have the opportunity to refine it(them). I am excited to review this data because such responses may inform my next survey. The categories included: Asian or Pacific Islander Black or African American Hispanic or Latino Native American or Alaskan Native White or Caucasian Biracial or multiracial An international/global identity that does not fit in the U.S. categorization of race/ethnicity A race/ethnicity not listed above Respondents could select multiple categories. Additionally, they could write in an identity that better aligned with their self-understanding. Image of a survey item inquiring about race/ethnicity from a survey. Each option has an option for the respondent to clarify. The option to select multiple boxes results in some extra coding when preparing the data for analysis. I am taking approach that we will listen to the data and decide, based on the results, how to report the findings in a way that will efficiently fit into an APA style empirical paper and honor the respondents. The population of interest for this particular study are those who are engaged in protest activities regarding hiring practices and policies that result in discrimination to members of the LGBTQIA+ community. This means that questions of gender identity, pronouns, and relationship to the LGBTQIA+ community are important to the research, and need to be asked sensitively and with great security of the data. Regarding gender identity, I used a similar approach, allowing individuals to select multiple categories and offering write-in boxes for each. The categories included: female male nonbinary trans woman trans man another identity (with a write-in box) prefer not to say Additionally, I invited individuals to identify their pronouns. Again, write-in boxes were offered with each option. they/them/theirs she/her/hers he/him/his they/she/he neo pronouns (e.g., xe/xem/xyr, ze/hir/hirs, ey/em/eir) another identity (with a write-in box) Finally, we wanted individuals to indicate their relationship to the LGBTQIA+ community. We asked them to select all that apply. Only the “something else” box had a write-in option: Member Exploring/Questioning Ally Not related Something else (with a write-in box) I expect that my future surveys may inquire about these variables differently. If you have found a different way to ask, please consider e-mailing me. I would love to provide different options and give credit to contributors. 2.6.2 Survey Order Historically, demographic information has been first or last in the survey. Although some research has reported no differences in response rates when demographic and sensitive data are at the beginning or end (Krathwohl, 2009; Rowley, 2014), I am inclined to open the survey with questionnaire items that are closely related to the topic listed on the recruitment materials and end the survey with the demographic information. Why? It makes sense to me that if someone has responded positively to the survey topic, they expect to answer questions (right away) about that topic. In between that opening survey and closing demographic items, I consider if there are any order effects that would engage in undue priming of responses. If there are such concerns, I think through the order to minimize these biasing effects. If there are no such concerns, I put my surveys in blocks and then ask my survey program to randomly present the blocks. This serves two purposes: counterbalancing possible order effects, and distributing missingness for individuals who do not complete the survey. 2.6.3 Forced Responses Programs like Qualtrics are able to engage in a variety of content validation procedures. If these are in place, they may require the person to enter a properly formatted response (e.g., phone number, e-mail address, numerical response between 0 and 100) before responding. These are extremely helpful tools in collecting data that will be closest-to-being-ready-for-analysis. These same procedures can force or request a response. Requiring a response is tempting. However, doing so violates IRB requirements that allow a person to skip or “quit at any time without penalty.” They may also anger a person such that they stop responding. Some researchers get around this by requiring the response, but including a “Not applicable” or “Prefer to not answer” column. Because I worry that (a) the respondent may confuse that option with one extreme of the scale and/or (b) my research team and I will forget to code it as missing data, I prefer the request response alternative. In Qualtrics in particular, I turn on the “Request response” feature for each of the questions. If an item is skipped, a simple warning is displayed that invites the respondent to review the page of answers to see if they would like to answer the question. If not, they can simply move forward. 2.7 Practice Problems In each of these lessons I provide suggestions for practice that allow you to select one or more problems that are graded in difficulty. With each of these options I encourage you to: This is a two-part lesson on questionnaire construction. After the second lesson, a detailed suggestion for practice will be provided that lists criteria for creating and piloting a survey of your own.

While the majority of R objects and data you will need are created within the R script that sources the chapter, occasionally there are some that cannot be created from within the R framework. Additionally, sometimes links fail. All original materials are provided at the Github site that hosts the book. More detailed guidelines for ways to access all these materials are provided in the OER’s introduction 3.1.1 Learning Objectives Focusing on this week’s materials, make sure you can: Utilize basic Qualtrics tools (e.g,. question type, use of headers) so that surveys are present materials clearly to the respondent. Incorporate more advanced tools (e.g., display logic, randomization) that may increase the respondent’s ability to complete the survey and provide accurate responses. Provide a rationale for survey options that protect (or possibly reveal) an individual’s identity. 3.1.2 Planning for Practice This is the second of a two-part lesson on questionnaire construction. At the end of this lesson is a detailed suggestion for practice that lists criteria for creating and piloting a survey of your own. There are four essential criteria for your survey: Adhere to the evidence-based practices identified in the lesson on questionnaire construction. Utilize four techniques (in the context of Qualtrics, I term these qualTRIXter skills) that increase the flow, effectiveness, and appearance of your survey. Pilot and consider feedback provided by those who took the survey. Import the data into the R environment. 3.1.3 Readings &amp; Resources In preparing this chapter, I drew heavily from the tutorials available at the Qualtrics support site. I have tried to link them throughout the presentation. It is likely they could change at any time and/or they might not work on your particular browser. 3.1.4 Packages The packages used in this lesson are embedded in this code.

The only surveys in this account are for the Recentering Psych Stats chapters and lessons. All surveys are designed to not capture personally identifying information and not collecting IP addresses nor longitude/latitude. I use this survey in several lessons in this OER. If you haven’t taken the survey yet, I invite you to do so, now. As a teaching activity for the ReCentering Psych Stats OER, the topic of the survey was selected to be consistent with the overall theme of OER. Specifically, the purpose of this study is to understand the campus climate for students whose identities make them vulnerable to bias and discrimination. These include students who are Black, non-Black students of color, LGBTQ+ students, international students, and students with disabilities. After consulting with a diverse group of stakeholders and subject matter experts (and revising the response options numerous times) I have attempted to center anti-Black racism in the U.S. (Mosley et al., 2020, 2021; Singh, 2020). In fact, the display logic does not present the race items when the course is offered outside the U.S. There are only five options for race: biracial/multiracial, Black, non-Black person(s) of color, White, and I did not notice (intended to capture a color-blind response). One unintended negative consequence of this design is that the response options could contribute to colorism (Adames et al., 2021; Capielo Rosario et al., 2019). Another possibility is that the limited options may erase, or make invisible, other identities. At the time that I wrote up the first description of this survey, the murder of six Asian American women in Atlanta had just occurred. The Center for the Study of Hate and Extremeism has documented that while overall hate drimes dropped by 7% in 2020, anti-Asian hate crimes reported to the police in America’s largest cities increased by 149% (FACT SHEET, n.d.). These incidents have occurred not only in cities, but in our neighborhoods and on our campusus (P. Kim, 2021; P. Y. Kim, 2021; STOP AAPI HATE, n.d.). While this survey is intended to assess campus climate as a function of race, it unfortunately does not distinguish between many identities that experience marginalization. Although the dataset should provide the opportunity to test a number of statistical models, one working hypothesis that framed the study is that the there will be a greater sense of belonging and less bias and discrimination when there is similar representation (of identities that are often marginalized) in the instructional faculty and student body. Termed, “structural diversity” (K. R. Lewis &amp; Shah, 2019) this is likely an oversimplification. In fact, an increase in diverse representation without attention to interacting factors can increase hostility on campus (Hurtado, 2007). Thus, the task of rating of a single course relates to the larger campus along the dimensions of belonging and bias/discrimination. For example, if a single class has higher ratings on issues of inclusivity, diversity, and respect, we would expect that sentiment to be echoed in the broader institution. The survey design has notable limitations You will likely notice that we ask about demographic characteristics of the instructional staff and classmates in the course rated, but we do not ask about the demographic characteristics of the respondent. In making this decision, we likely lose important information. For example, Iacovino and James (2016) have noted that White students perceive campus more favorably than Black student counterparts. The decision to not collect demographic details about the respondent was about protecting their (your) identity. As you will see, you have the opportunity to download and analyze the data. If a faculty member asked an entire class to take the survey, the datestamp and a handful of demographic identifiers could very likely identify a student. In certain circumstances, this might be risky in that private information (i.e., gender nonconformity, disclosure of a disability) along with course evaluation data and a date stamp could identify the respondent. Further, the items that ask respondents to guess the identities of the instructional staff and classmates are limited, and contrary to best practices in survey construction that recommend providing the option of a “write-in” a response. In parallel, the items asking respondents to identity characteristics of the instructional staff along dimensions of gender, international status, and disability are “large buckets” and do not include “write-in” options. Similarly, there was no intent to cause harm by erasing or making invisible individuals whose identities are better defined by different descriptors. Further, no write-in items were allowed. This was also intentional to prevent potential harm caused by people who could leave inappropriate, racist, or otherwise harmful comments. As I review Qualtrics essentials and trix, I will their use (if used) in the ReCentering Psych Stats survey. 3.3 Qualtrics Essentials Qualtrics is a powerful program and I find that many of the surveys we distribute don’t capitalize on the features Qualtrics has to offer. Qualtrics has detailed tutorials and instructions that are well worth the investment of a weekend to review them. In this lecture I will point you to the elements that I think are critical to constructing online surveys. Because Qualtrics tutorials are (a) clear and thorough and (b) frequently updated, I will (a) point you to the tutorials that are available at the time of this lecture prep, (b) tell you why I think they are appropriate, and (c) show you how we have used them in some of our own surveys. Even if you think you know what you are doing, start here (and then always take the time to “look around” at all the options on each window): Survey Basic Overview: Qualtrics’ Survey Basic Overiew tutorial is a great place to start. From there, you can follow all kinds of leads, looking for things you want to do with your survey – and getting ideas for what will improve it. Blocks are the basic organizational tool in Qualtrics surveys. Blocks have two purposes: (a) grouping items shown on “one page,” and (b) specifying ordering and/or random selection/presentation in the survey flow. Question types: Take time to look at all the options. You might be surprised to learn that there is a better choice than you might have imagined. Let’s take a look at super basic/helpful question types: Text/graphic: These are the types you should use for providing information (e.g., informed consent) to the participants or displaying a logo or graphic stimulus. Matrix table: The matrix table is a more efficient way to use the Likert-style items (than multiple choice). There is some controversy about whether not to use matrix tables vs. multiple choice dropdowns. As both a survey developer and a respondent, I prefer the matrix table. Make sure to select a reasonable amount of header repetitions. This allows the respondent the maximum opportunity to see the column descriptors (and avoid guessing/remembering) while they are responding. Slider : The slider is designed for obtaining truly continuous data on a 1 to 100 scale. This range can be adapted to any interval you choose and you can add anchors to the scale. If the scale you are using is already published, and has not been psychometrically evaluated for slider use, you should probably stick with the format recommended in the publication. But if you are writing test items, consider this option. Text Entry Questions:Text boxes have multiple options for answer length. Validation: Content validation allows the user to permit certain types of information and specify their formats (e.g., numbers, e-mail addresses, dates). There is art to balancing between being overly restricting and ensuring that the data is entered in the most clear and consistent way possible with honoring the uniqueness of each respondent. Another validation option I frequently use is one that asks individuals if they intended to leave something blank. This is tool that helps prevent missingness without forcing an individual to respond to an item that (a) might not be clear to them, (b) might not be appropriate or them, and/or (c) might result in an answer that is untrue for their unique circumstance. 3.4 Qual-TRIX Collaborating with other Qualtrics users in your institution is easy! Scroll down to “Collaborating Inside Your Organization” and follow the instructions for adding individuals to your survey (you must “own” the surve; your collaborators will not be able to add others). The ability to schedule survey distributions is like having your very own assistant! If you have a roster (contact list) you can schedule distributions, reminders, and thank yous. Qualtrics will keep track of who responds and send reminders to the non-responders. Here are resources for E-mail overview E-mail distribution management Directories Personalizing invitations and surveys. Piped text is a way to personalize invitations and/or “carry forward” prior responses into new questions. Randomization of blocks (or a subset of blocks) can be use for several purposes such as: (a) using random selection to display one or more blocks to respondents – as in a random clinical trial, (b) to randomly display a percentage of blocks or items to shorten the survey in a planned missing design, and (c) randomly display some or all of the blocks of the survey to all respondents so that when respondents experience test fatigue, when they quit responding, “the last items/surveys” aren’t always the same ones. This functions to distribute missingness across surveys. Randomization of items within a block can be used for similar purposes. You can also use this to display only some of the items (e.g., planned missingness). File upload from respondents is an additional package that requires the institution to pay a higher fee. If available, this allows respondents to upload some sort of file (photo, powerpoint, .pdf). We use it for poster contests at professional contests (where students upload their poster for online judging in advance of the conference). A colleague of mine uses this function to collect application elements (i.e., resumes, cover letters, reference letters) to a fellowship program. As researchers, we can also upload files (e.g., hardcopy of informed consent, documents to be reviewed) for use by the respondent. Display, Skip, and/or Branch Logic can be used to help display to respondents only the items that pertain to them. There are multiple approaches to doing this. Using a display logic approach may feel a bit backward where the logic is applied from the landing spot. We did this extensively in as study that involved two language versions and three age options. Two other approaches for these issues are skip logic and branch logic 3.5 Even moRe, particularly relevant to iRb We can use Qualtrics tools for purposes beyond collecting and downloading data. These tools are especially useful when I think about IRB applications and ethics related to data collection. Exporting to Word: Helpful for your IRB application (and perhaps in a cloud so that a team can use track changes to edit), it is super simple to export the survey to Microsoft Word. Additionally, you can specify options for including question numbers, recode values, logic, and so forth. This works well to create a codebook for your research team. Anonymizing responses: Another step toward an anonymous response is to withhold the IP address, latitude/longitude, and any contact information (e.g., e-mail, name) that you may have uploaded in an e-mail distribution directory. This is accomplished in the Survey Options menu. Do be careful – while anonymizing responses is an ethical, best practice, the deleted information cannot be recovered. Prevent ballot box stuffing: Want to make sure that respondents only answer once? In the same Survey Options window, you can prevent ballot box stuffing. This is helpful when surveys are distributed with an anonymous link. The tool prevents more than one survey from the same IP address. Other security options include Password protection HTTP Referer verification Look also at: Progress bar to provide particpants hope (or despair) for “how much longer.” Survey termination to connect custom endings and thank-you notes. Partial completion to specify how long the respondent has to complete the survey (after opening it) and whether it is recorded or deleted if it is not completed. Related to this, back on the Data &amp; Analysis tab, you can see both the numberss of recorded responses and responses in progress. You also have options to manually determine how you want to include/exclude the responses in progress. Failure of the respondent to click the final “–&gt;” submit and progress symbol is often the reason that surveys that are &gt; 90% complete aren’t counted as “complete.” What to do? Options: (a) don’t say “Thanks and goodbye” on a page that has any items, and (b) provide instructions to look for the “–&gt;” symbol to continue. Finally, PREVIEW PREVIEW PREVIEW! There is no better way check your work than with previews. 3.6 intRavenous Qualtrics Access credentials for the institutional account, individual user’s account, and survey are essential for getting the survey items and/or results to export into R. The Qualtrics website provides a tutorial for generating an API token. We need two pieces of information: the root_url and an API token. Log into your respective qualtrics.com account. Select Account Settings Choose “Qualtrics IDs” from the user name dropdown We need the root_url. This is the first part of the web address for the Qualtrics account. For our institution it is: spupsych.az1.qualtrics.com The API token is in the box labeled, “API.” If it is empty, select, “Generate Token.” If you do not have this option, locate the brand administrator for your Qualtrics account. They will need to set up your account so that you have API privileges. BE CAREFUL WITH THE API TOKEN This is the key to your Qualtrics accounts. If you leave it in an .rmd file that you forward to someone else, this key and the base URL gives access to every survey in your account. If you share it, you could be releasing survey data to others that would violate confidentiality promises in an IRB application. If you mistakenly give out your API token you can generate a new one within your Qualtrics account and re-protect all its contents. You do need to change the API key/token if you want to download data from a different Qualtrics account. If your list of surveys generates the wrong set of surveys, restart R, make sure you have the correct API token and try again. # only have to run this ONCE to draw from the same Qualtrics # account...but will need to get different #token if you are changing # between accounts. qualtRics::qualtrics_api_credentials(api_key = &quot;oEwd9qu9xJOf3RoE9iiCZKSs2sfNuSbvy8LnFYxo&quot;, base_url = &quot;spupsych.az1.qualtrics.com&quot;, overwrite = TRUE, install = TRUE) readRenviron(&quot;~/.Renviron&quot;) all_surveys() generates a dataframe containing information about all the surveys stored on your Qualtrics account. surveys &lt;- qualtRics::all_surveys() # View this as an object (found in the right: Environment).

As I demonstrated above, we can export a codebook, that is, a Word (or PDF) version of the survey with all the coding. In Qualtrics the protocol is: Survey/Tools/ImportExport/Export Survey to Word. Then select all the options you want (especially “Show Coded Values”). A tutorial provided by Qualtrics can be found here. This same process can be used to print the PDF example I used above. I recommend providing custom variable names and recode values directly in Qualtrics before exporting them into R (and before exporting the codebook). A Qualtrics tutorial for this is provided here. In general, consider these qualities when creating variable names: Brevity: historically, SPSS variable names could be a maximum of 8 characters. Intuitive: although variables can be renamed in R (e.g., for use in charts and tables), it is helpful when the name imported from Qualtrics provides some indication of what the variable is. Systematic: start items in a scale with the same stem, followed by the item number – ITEM1, ITEM2, ITEM3. Do not include special characters or spaces in variable names; this is problematic for R. Do not start variable names with numerals; this is problematic for R. More complete information about data preparation is covered in chapters in the ReCentering Psych Stats: Multivariate Modeling text. 3.6.2 Using data from an exported Qualtrics .csv file It is is also possible to download the Qualtrics data in a variety of formats (e.g., CSV, Excel, SPSS). Since my R and Qualtrics history began by using files with the CSV extension (think “Excel” lite), that is my preference. In Qualtrics, these are the steps to download the data: Projects/YOURsurvey/Data &amp; Analysis/Export &amp; Import/Export data/CSV/Use numeric values. In order to import this data into R, it is critical that to save this file in the same folder as the .rmd file that you will use with the data. R is sensitive to characters used filenames As downloaded, my Qualtrics .csv file had a long name with spaces and symbols that are not allowed. Therore, I gave it a simple, sensible, filename, “ReC_Download210319.csv”. An idiosyncracy of mine is to datestamp filenames. I use two-digit representations of the year, month, and date so that if the letters preceding the date are the same, the files would alphabetize automatically. # QTRX_csv &lt;- qualtRics::read_survey(&#39;ReC_Download210319.csv&#39;, # strip_html = TRUE, import_id = FALSE, time_zone=NULL, legacy = # FALSE) Although minor tweaking may be required, the same script above should be applicable to this version of the data. 3.6.3 Tweaking Data Format Two general approaches: Inside Qualtrics: Use the recode values option (found in the item’s gearbox, to the left of the block) to specify variable names and recode values. These should be preserved on the download. In the R script: In another lecture I demonstrate how to change the formats of data (character, string), selecting only the variables in which we are interested (e.g., excluding the meta-data), and renaming variables sensibly. Both work! You can choose your preference. When you are working with a team, map out an explicit process with your collaborators. 3.7 Practice Problems The suggestion for practice is to develop a questionnaire, format it, pilot it, and download it. Essentially you will be Formatting a survey on Qualtrics using all the best practices identified in the lecture. These include: Having an introductory statement (to include statement of confidentiality), directions for each sub-survey (if more than one), and closing statement. Selecting the most appropriate question type for the items. For example, matrix instead of multiple choice. Within the question type, using the appropriate options for proper formatting (e.g., the anchors in a matrix should be topically consistent and equal-interval). The survey should include minimum of 3 of the qualTRIXter skills (identified in lecture). Choose from: establishing collaboration scheduling e-mail distribution and follow-up personalizing the survey in some way randomization of blocks or items integrating display, skip, or branch logic (e.g., having males and females take a different route) exporting the survey to Word recoding variables in the item controls anonymizing the responses preventing ballot box stuffing including a progress bar creating a custom ending, e-mail, or thank-you note something else that YOU discovered that isn’t in the lecture Piloting it, getting their feedback, and identifying what problems are (and how you might fix them). with 3 folks from your research team, cohort, or this class with 3 additional folks who aren’t quite as “research savvy” collect their feedback (ideally in a text-item directly on the survey itself) and write a brief summary (3 paragraphs max) of their impressions and how you might improve the survey Import the Qualtrics data directly R preferably, directly from Qualtrics with the API token, base URL, and survey ID alternatively (for the same # of points) from the exported CSV file via the qualtRics package (required) Assignment Component Points Possible Points Earned 1.

This includes understanding some of the concerns of validity, different aspects of validity, and factors as they affect validity coefficients. 4.1 Navigating this Lesson There is just over one hour of lecture. If you work through the materials with me it would be plan for an additional hour. While the majority of R objects and data you will need are created within the R script that sources the chapter, occasionally there are some that cannot be created from within the R framework. Additionally, sometimes links fail. All original materials are provided at the Github site that hosts the book. More detailed guidelines for ways to access all these materials are provided in the OER’s introduction 4.1.1 Learning Objectives Focusing on this week’s materials, make sure you can: Distinguish between different types of validity based on short descriptions. Compute and interpret validity coefficients. Evaluate the incremental validity of an instrument-of-interest. Define and interpret the standard error of estimate. Develop a rationale that defends importance of establishing the validity of a measuring instrument. 4.1.2 Planning for Practice In each of these lessons I provide suggestions for practice that allow you to select one or more problems that are graded in difficulty. The least complex is to change the random seed in the research and rework the problem demonstrated in the lesson. The results should map onto the ones obtained in the lecture. The second option involves utilizing one of the simulated datasets available in this OER. The last lesson in the OER contains three simulations that could be used for all of the statistics-based practice suggestions. At this very first lesson which involves statistics, I strongly encourage you to select one of these sets and use it for all of the statistics-based homework. Working a single instrument “all the way through” a psychometric evaluation is a great way to (a) understand the psychometric evaluation workflow and (b) get to know an instrument. Alternatively, Lewis and Neville’s (2015) Gendered Racial Microaggressions Scale for Black Women will be used in the lessons on exploratory factor analysis; Keum et al.’s Gendered Racial Microaggressions Scale for Asian American Women (Keum et al., 2018) will be used in the lessons on confirmatory factor analysis; and Conover et al.’s (2017) Ableist Microaggressions Scale is used in the lesson on invariance testing. Any of these would be suitable for the PCA and PAF homework assignments. As a third option, you are welcome to use data to which you have access and is suitable for validity testing. In any case, please select a scale that has item-level data for which there is a theorized total scale score as well as two or more subscales (three subscales is ideal). With each of these options, plan to: Create a correlation matrix that includes the instrument-of-interest and the variables that will have varying degrees of relation*. With convergent and discriminant validity in mind, interpret the validity coefficients; this should include an assessment about whether the correlation coefficients (at least two different pairings) are statistically significantly different from each other. With at least three variables, evaluate the degree to which the instrument demonstrates incremental validity 4.1.3 Readings &amp; Resources In preparing this chapter, I drew heavily from the following resource(s). Other resources are cited (when possible, linked) in the text with complete citations in the reference list. Jhangiani, R. S., Chiang, I.-C. A., Cuttler, C., &amp; Leighton, D. C. (2019). Reliability and Validity. In Research Methods in Psychology. https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/HF7DQ Clark, L. A. &amp; Watson, D. (1995). Constructing validity: Basic issues in objective scale development. Psychological Assessment, 7, 309-319. In this manuscript, Clark and Watson (1995) create a beautiful blend of theoretical issues and practical suggestions for creating measures that evidence construct validity. From the practical perspective, the authors first guide potential scale constructors through the literature review and creating an item pool (including tips on writing items). The authors address structural validity by first beginning with strategies for constructing the test. In this section, the authors revisit the issue of dimensionality (i.e., alpha vs. factor analysis). Finally, the authors look at initial data collection (addressing sample size) and psychometric evaluation. 4.1.4 Packages The packages used in this lesson are embedded in this code. When the hashtags are removed, the script below will (a) check to see if the following packages are installed on your computer and, if not (b) install them. # will install the package if not already installed # if(!require(tidyverse)){install.packages(&#39;tidyverse&#39;)} # if(!require(MASS)){install.packages(&#39;MASS&#39;)} # if(!require(psych)){install.packages(&#39;psych&#39;)} 4.2 Research Vignette This lesson provides descriptions of numerous pathways for establishing an instrument’s validity. In fact, best practices involving numerous demonstrations of validity. Across several lessons, we will rework several of the correlational analyses reported in the research vignette. For this lesson in particular, the research vignette allows demonstrations of convergent/discriminant validity and incremental validity. The research vignette for this lesson is the development and psychometric evaluation of the Perceptions of the LGBTQ College Campus Climate Scale (Szymanski &amp; Bissonette, 2020). The scale is six items with responses rated on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Higher scores indicate more negative perceptions of the LGBTQ campus climate. Szymanski and Bissonette have suggested that the psychometric evaluation supports using the scale in its entirety or as subscales composed of the following items: College Response to LGBTQ students: My university/college is cold and uncaring toward LGBTQ students. My university/college is unresponsive to the needs of LGBTQ students. My university/college provides a supportive environment for LGBTQ students. [un]supportive; must be reverse-scored LGBTQ Stigma: Negative attitudes toward LGBTQ persons are openly expressed on my university/college campus. Heterosexism, homophobia, biphobia, transphobia, and cissexism are visible on my university/college campus. LGBTQ students are harassed on my university/college campus. A preprint of the article is available at ResearchGate. Because data is collected at the item level (and I want this resource to be as practical as possible), I have simulated the data for each of the scales utilized in the research vignette at the item level. Simulating the data involved using factor loadings, means, standard deviations, and correlations between the scales. Because the simulation will produce “out-of-bounds” values, the code below re-scales the scores into the range of the Likert-type scaling and rounds them to whole values. Five additional scales were reported in the Szymanski and Bissonette article (2020). Unfortunately, I could not locate factor loadings for all of them; and in two cases, I used estimates from a more recent psychometric analysis. When the individual item and their factor loadings were known, I assigned names based on item content (e.g., “lo_energy”) rather than using item numbers (e.g., “PHQ4”). When I am doing psychometric analyses, I prefer item-level names so that I can quickly see (without having to look up the item content) how the items are behaving. While the focus of this series of chapters is on the LGBTQ Campus Climate scale, this simulated data might be useful to you in one or more of the suggestions for practice (e.g., examining the psychometric characteristics of one or the other scales). The scales, their original citation, and information about how I simulated data for each are listed below. Sexual Orientation-Based Campus Victimization Scale (Herek, 1993) is a 9-item item scale with Likert scaling ranging from 0 (never) to 3 (two or more times). Because I was not able to locate factor loadings from a psychometric evaluation, I simulated the data by specifying a 0.8 as a standardized factor loading for each of the items. College Satisfaction Scale (Helm et al., 1998) is a 5-item scale with Likert scaling ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Higher scores represent greater college satisfaction. Because I was not able to locate factor loadings from a psychometric evaluation, I simulated the data by specifying a 0.8 as a standardized factor loading for each of the items. Institutional and Goals Commitment (Pascarella &amp; Terenzini, 1980) is a 6-item subscale from a 35-item measure assessing academic/social integration and institutional/goal commitment (5 subscales total). The measure had with Likert scaling ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Higher scores on the institutional and goals commitment subscale indicate greater intentions to persist in college. Data were simulated using factor loadings in the source article. GAD-7 (Spitzer et al., 2006) is a 7-item scale with Likert scaling ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). Higher scores indicate more anxiety. I simulated data by estimating factor loadings from Brattmyr et al. (2022). PHQ-9 (Kroenke et al., 2001) is a 9-item scale with Likert scaling ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). Higher scores indicate higher levels of depression. I simulated data by estimating factor loadings from Brattmyr et al. (2022). #Entering the intercorrelations, means, and standard deviations from the journal article Szymanski_generating_model &lt;- &#39; #measurement model CollegeResponse =~ .88*cold + .73*unresponsive + .73*supportive Stigma =~ .86*negative + .76*heterosexism + .71*harassed Victimization =~ .8*Vic1 + .8*Vic2 + .8*Vic3 + .8*Vic4 + .8*Vic5 + .8*Vic6 + .8*Vic7 + .8*Vic8 + .8*Vic9 CollSat =~ .8*Sat1 + .8*Sat2 + .8*Sat3 + .8*Sat4 + .8*Sat5 Persistence =~ .69*graduation_importance + .63*right_decision + .62*will_register + .59*not_graduate + .45*undecided + .44*grades_unimportant Anxiety =~ .851*nervous + .887*worry_control + .894*much_worry + 674*cant_relax + .484*restless + .442*irritable + 716*afraid Depression =~ .798*anhedonia + .425*down + .591*sleep + .913*lo_energy + .441*appetite + .519*selfworth + .755*concentration + .454*too_slowfast + .695*s_ideation #Means CollegeResponse ~ 2.71*1 Stigma ~3.61*1 Victimization ~ 0.11*1 CollSat ~ 5.61*1 Persistence ~ 4.41*1 Anxiety ~ 1.45*1 Depression ~1.29*1 #Correlations CollegeResponse ~~ .58*Stigma CollegeResponse ~~ -.25*Victimization CollegeResponse ~~ -.59*CollSat CollegeResponse ~~ -.29*Persistence CollegeResponse ~~ .17*Anxiety CollegeResponse ~~ .18*Depression Stigma ~~ .37*Victimization Stigma ~~ -.41*CollSat Stigma ~~ -.19*Persistence Stigma ~~ .27*Anxiety Stigma ~~ .24*Depression Victimization ~~ -.22*CollSat Victimization ~~ -.04*Persistence Victimization ~~ .23*Anxiety Victimization ~~ .21*Depression CollSat ~~ .53*Persistence CollSat ~~ -.29*Anxiety CollSat ~~ -.32*Depression Persistence ~~ -.22*Anxiety Persistence ~~ -.26*Depression Anxiety ~~ .76*Depression &#39; set.seed(240218) dfSzy &lt;- lavaan::simulateData(model = Szymanski_generating_model, model.type = &quot;sem&quot;, meanstructure = T, sample.nobs=646, standardized=FALSE) #used to retrieve column indices used in the rescaling script below col_index &lt;- as.data.frame(colnames(dfSzy)) #The code below loops through each column of the dataframe and assigns the scaling accordingly #Rows 1 thru 6 are the Perceptions of LGBTQ Campus Climate Scale #Rows 7 thru 15 are the Sexual Orientation-Based Campus Victimization Scale #Rows 16 thru 20 are the College Satisfaction Scale #Rows 21 thru 26 are the Institutional and Goals Commitment Scale #Rows 27 thru 33 are the GAD7 #Rows 34 thru 42 are the PHQ9 for(i in 1:ncol(dfSzy)){ if(i &gt;= 1 &amp; i &lt;= 6){ dfSzy[,i] &lt;- scales::rescale(dfSzy[,i], c(1, 7)) } if(i &gt;= 7 &amp; i &lt;= 15){ dfSzy[,i] &lt;- scales::rescale(dfSzy[,i], c(0, 3)) } if(i &gt;= 16 &amp; i &lt;= 20){ dfSzy[,i] &lt;- scales::rescale(dfSzy[,i], c(1, 7)) } if(i &gt;= 21 &amp; i &lt;= 26){ dfSzy[,i] &lt;- scales::rescale(dfSzy[,i], c(1, 5)) } if(i &gt;= 27 &amp; i &lt;= 33){ dfSzy[,i] &lt;- scales::rescale(dfSzy[,i], c(0, 3)) } if(i &gt;= 34 &amp; i &lt;= 42){ dfSzy[,i] &lt;- scales::rescale(dfSzy[,i], c(0, 3)) } } #rounding to integers so that the data resembles that which was collected library(tidyverse) dfSzy &lt;- dfSzy %&gt;% round(0) #quick check of my work #psych::describe(dfSzy) #Reversing the supportive item on the Perceptions of LGBTQ Campus Climate Scale so that the exercises will be consistent with the format in which the data was collected dfSzy &lt;- dfSzy %&gt;% dplyr::mutate(supportiveNR = 8 - supportive) #Reversing three items on the Institutional and Goals Commitments scale so that the exercises will be consistent with the format in which the data was collected dfSzy &lt;- dfSzy %&gt;% dplyr::mutate(not_graduateNR = 8 - not_graduate)%&gt;% dplyr::mutate(undecidedNR = 8 - undecided)%&gt;% dplyr::mutate(grades_unimportantNR = 8 - grades_unimportant) dfSzy &lt;- dplyr::select(dfSzy, -c(supportive, not_graduate, undecided, grades_unimportant)) The optional script below will let you save the simulated data to your computing environment as either an .rds object (preserves any formatting you might do) or a.csv file (think “Excel lite”). # to save the df as an .rds (think &#39;R object&#39;) file on your computer; # it should save in the same file as the .rmd file you are working # with saveRDS(dfSzy, &#39;SzyDF.rds&#39;) bring back the simulated dat from # an .rds file dfSzy &lt;- readRDS(&#39;SzyDF.rds&#39;) # write the simulated data as a .csv write.table(dfSzy, # file=&#39;SzyDF.csv&#39;, sep=&#39;,&#39;, col.names=TRUE, row.names=FALSE) bring # back the simulated dat from a .csv file dfSzy &lt;- read.csv(&quot;SzyDF.csv&quot;, header = TRUE) As we move into the lecture, allow me to provide a content advisory. Individuals who hold LGBTQIA+ identities are frequently the recipients of discrimination and harassment. If you are curious about why these items are considered to be stigmatizing or non-responsive, please do not ask a member of the LGBTQIA+ community to explain it to you; it is not their job to educate others on discrimination, harassment, and microaggressions. Rather, please read the article in its entirety. Additionally, resources such as The Trevor Project, GLSEN, and Campus Pride are credible sources of information for learning more. 4.3 Fundamentals of Validity Validity (the classic definition) is the ability of a test to measure what it purports to measure. Supporting that definition are these notions: Validity is extent of matching, congruence, or “goodness of fit” between the operational definition and concept it is supposed to measure. An instrument is said to be valid if it taps the concept it claims to measure. Validity is the appropriateness of the interpretation of the results of an assessment procedure for a given group of individuals, not to the procedure itself. Validity is a matter of degree; it does not exist on an all-or-none basis. Validity is always specific to some particular use or interpretation. Validity is a unitary concept. Validity involves an overall evaluative judgment. Over the years (and, perhaps within each construct), validity has somewhat of an evolutionary path from a focus on content, to prediction, to theory and hypothesis testing. When the focus is on content, we are concerned with the: Assessment of what individuals had learned in specific content areas. Relevance of its content (i.e., we compare the content to the content domain). When the focus is on prediction, we are concerned with: How different persons respond in a given situation (now or later). The correlation coefficient between test scores (predictor) and the assessment of a criterion (performance in a situation) A focus on theory and hypothesis testing adds: A strengthened theoretical orientation. A close linkage between psychological theory and verification through empirical and experimental hypothesis testing. An emphasis on constructs in describing and understanding human behavior. Constructs are broad categories, derived from the common features shared by directly observable behavioral variables. They are theoretical entities and not directly observable. Construct validity is at the heart of psychometric evaluation. We define construct validity as the fundamental and all-inclusive validity concept, insofar as it specifies what the test measures. Content and predictive validation procedures are among the many sources of information that contribute to the understanding of the constructs assessed by a test. 4.4 Validity Criteria We have just stated that validity is an overall, evaluative judgment. Within that umbrella are different criteria by which we judge the validity of a measure. We casually refer to them as types, but each speaks to that unitary concept. 4.4.1 Content Validity Content validity is concerned with the representativeness of the domain being assessed. Content validation procedures may differ depending on whether the test is in the educational/achievement context or if it is more of an attitude/behavioral survey. In the educational/achievement context, content validation seeks to ensure the items on an exam are appropriate for the content domain being assessed. A table of specifications is a two-way chart which indicates the instructionally relevant learning tasks to be measured. Percentages in the table indicate the relative degree of emphasis that each content area Let’s imagine that I was creating a table of specifications for items on a quiz for this very chapter. The columns represent the types of outcomes we might expect. The American Psychological Association often talks about KSAs (knowledge, skills, attitudes), so I will utilize those as a framework. You’ll notice that the number of items and percentages do not align mathematically. Because, in the exam, I would likely weight application items (e.g., “work the problem”) more highly than knowledge items (e.g., multiple choice, true/false), the relative weighting may differ. Table of Specifications Learning Objectives Knowledge Skills Attitudes % of test Distinguish between different types of validity based on short descriptions. 6 items 30% Compute and interpret validity coefficients. 2 items 15% Evaluate the incremental validity of an instrument-of-interest. 1 item 20% Define and interpret the standard error of estimate. 1 item 15% Develop a rationale that defends importance of establishing the validity of a measuring instrument. 1 item 20% TOTALS 7 items 3 items 1 item 100% Subject matter experts (SMEs) are individuals chosen to evaluate items based on their degree of knowledge of the subject being assessed. If SMES are used, the researcher should: Report how many SMEs and list their professional qualifications. Report any directions the SMEs were given; if they were used to evaluate items, report the extent of agreement. Empirical procedures for enhancing content validity of educational assessments may include: Comparing item-level and total scores with grades; lower grades should get lower scores. Analyzing individual errors. Observing student work methods (have the students “think aloud” in front of an examiner). Evaluating the role of speed, noting how many do not complete the test in the time allowed. Correlating the scores with a reading comprehension test (if the exam is highly correlated, then it may be a test of reading and not another subject). Alternatively, if it is a reading comprehension test, give the student the questions (without the passage) to see how well they answered the questions on the basis of prior knowledge. For surveys and tests outside of educational settings, content validation procedures ask, “Does the test cover a representative sample of the specified skills and knowledge?” and “Is test performance reasonably free from the influence of irrelevant variables?” Naturally, SMEs might be used. An example of content validation from Industrial-Organizational Psychology is the job analysis which precedes the development of test for employee selection and classification. Not all tests require content analysis. In aptitude and personality tests we are probably more interested in other types of validity evaluation. 4.4.2 Face Validity: The “Un”validity Face validity is concerned with the question, “How does an assessment look on the ‘face of it’?” Let’s imagine that on a qualification exam for electricians, a math item asks the electrician to estimate the amount of yarn needed to complete a project. The item may be more face valid if the calculation was with wire. Thus, face validity can often be improved by reformulating test items in terms that appear relevant and plausible for the context. Face validity should never be regarded as a substitute for objectively determined validity. In contrast, it should not be assumed that when a (valid and reliable) test has been modified to increase its face validity, that its objective validity and reliability is unaltered. That is, it should be reevaluated. 4.4.3 Criterion-Related Validity Criterion-related validity has to do with the test’s ability to predict an outcome (the criterion). If the criterion is something that occurs simultaneously, it is an assessment of concurrent validity; if it is in the future, it is an assessment of predictive validity. A criterion is the “thing” that the test should, theoretically, be able to predict. That prediction could be occurring at the same time (concurrent validity) or at a future time (predictive validity). Regardless, the estimate of the criteria must be independent of the survey/assessment being evaluated. The table below provides examples of types of tests and concurrent and predictive validity criteria. Type of Test Concurrent Criteria Example Predictive Criteria Example A shorter (or cheaper) standardized achievement test school grades, existing standardized tests subsequent graduation/college admissions, cumulative GPA Employee selection tests decision made by a search committee subsequent retention or promotion of the selected employee Assessment of depression severity (shorter or cheaper) diagnosis from a mental health professional; correlation with an established measure inpatient hospitalization or act of self-harm Contrasted groups is a specific type of criterion-related validity. Clearly differentiated groups (e.g., sales clerks versus excutives; engineers versus musicians) are chosen to see if exam performance or profiles differ in predictable ways. Criterion contamination occurs when test scores, themselves, are used to make decisions about the criteria. To prevent this: No person who participates in the assignment of criterion ratings can have any knowledge of the examinee’s test scores. The test scores must be kept strictly confidential. There are a number of issues related to criterion-related validity. Is the criterion choice appropriate? Criterion validity is only as good as the validity of the criterion to which one is making a comparison. In the 1980s and 1990s there was more attention in this area; that is critics questioned the quality of the criterion being used. To what degree can the results of criterion-related validity be generalized? Most tests are developed (intentionally) for a local context, setting, or audience. Consequently, in the local context, the criterion-prediction sample is usually too small (i.e., 50 cases or less). Those who want to generalize the test to a broader population should evaluate the test in relation to the new purpose. Is there a role for meta-analysis? Repeated validation studies of our tests, on different samples, results in a number of small-scale studies, each with their own validity coefficients. We can use meta-analytic procedures in reporting the results of validity coefficients when they are used for establishing criterion validity. 4.4.4 Construct Validity Construct validity was introduced in 1954 in the first edition of APA’s testing standards and is defined as the extent to which the test may be said to measure a theoretical construct or trait. The overarching focus is on the role of psychological theory in test construction and the ability to formulate hypotheses that can be supported (or not) in the evaluation process. Construct validity is established by the accumulation of information from a variety of sources. There are a number of sources that can be used to support construct validity. 4.4.5 Internal Consistency In the next chapter, you will learn that internal consistency is generally considered to be an index of reliability. In the context of criterion-related validity, a goal is to ensure that the criterion is the total score on the test itself. To that end, some of the following could also support this aspect of validity: Comparing high and low scorers. Items that fail to show a significantly greater proportion of “passes” in the upper than the lower group are considered invalid, and are modified or eliminated. Computing a biserial correlation between the item and total score. Correlating the subtest score with the total score. Any subtest whose correlation with the total score is too low is eliminated. Although some take issue with this notion, the degree of homogeneity (the degree to which items assess the same thing) has some bearing on construct validity. There is a tradeoff between items that measure a narrow slice of the construct definition (internal consistency estimates are likely to be higher) and those that sample the construct definition more broadly (internal consistency estimates are likely to be lower). Admittedly, the contribution of internal consistency data is limited. In absence of external data, it tells us little about WHAT the test measures. 4.4.6 Structural Validity 4.4.6.1 Exploratory Factor Analysis Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) is used to simplify the description of behavior by reducing the number of categories (factors or dimensions) to fewer than the number of items. In our research vignette the 6-item Perceptions of Campus Climate Scale will be represented by two factors (Szymanski &amp; Bissonette, 2020) In instrument development, techniques like principal components analysis or principal axis factoring are used to identify clusters (latent factors) among items. We frequently treat these as scales and subscales. Imagine the use of 20 tests to 300 people. There would be 190 correlations. Irrespective of content, we can probably summarize the intercorrelations of tests with 5-6 factors. When the clustering of tests includes vocabulary, analogies, opposites, and sentence completions, we might suggest a “verbal comprehension factor.” Factorial validity is the correlation of the test with whatever is common to a group of tests or other indices of behavior. If our single test has a correlation of .66 with the factor on which it loads, then the “factorial validity of the new test as a measure of the common trait is .66.” When EFA is utilized, the items are “fed” into an iterative process that analyzes the relations and “reveals” (or suggests – we are the ones who interpret the data) how many factors (think scales/subscales) and which items comprise them. 4.4.6.2 Confirmatory Factor Analysis Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) involves specifying, a priori, a proposed relationship of items, scales, and subscales and then testing its goodness of fit. In CFA (a form of structural equation modeling [SEM]), the latent variables (usually the higher order scales and total scale score) are positioned to cause the responses on the indicators/items. Subsequent lessons provide examples of both EFA and CFA approaches to psychometrics. 4.4.7 Experimental Interventions Construct validity is also supported by hypothesis testing and experimentation. If we expect that the construct assessed by the instrument is malleable (e.g., depression) and that an intervention could change it, then a random clinical trial that evaluated the effectiveness of an intervention (and it worked – depression scores declined) would simultaneously provide support for the intervention as well as the instrument. 4.4.8 Convergent and Discriminant Validity In a psychometric evaluation, we will often administer our instrument-of-interest along with a battery of instruments that are more-and-less related. Convergent validity is supported when there are moderately high correlations between our tests and the instruments with which we expect moderately high correlations. In contrast, discriminant validity is established by low and/or non-significant correlations between our instrument-of-interest and instruments that should be unrelated. For example, we want a low and non-significant correlation between a quantitative reasoning test and scores on a reading comprehension test. Why? Because if the correlation is too high, the test cannot discriminate between reading comprehension and math. There are no strict cut-offs to establish convergence or discrimination. We can even ask, “Could a correlation intended to support convergence be too high?” It is possible! Unless the instrument-of-interest offers advantages such as brevity or cost, then correlations that fall into the ranges of multicollinearity or singularity can indicate unnecessary duplication or redundancy. In our research vignette, Szymanski and Bissonette (2020) conducted a correlation matrix that reports the bivariate relations between the LGBTQ Campus Climate full-scale as well as the College Response and Stigma subscales with measures that assess (a) LGBTQ victimization, (b) satisfaction with college, (c) persistence attitudes, and (d) anxiety, and (e) depression. In order to produce this correlation matrix, we must first score each of the scales. In the items we prepared, the Perceptions of LGBTQ Campus Climate scale had one reverse-scored item. Similarly, the Institutional Goals and Commitments Scale had three reversed items. A first step in scoring is reversing these items. The naming conventions that researchers use vary. I added an “NR” (for “needs reversing) to the original items so that I would remember to reverse-score them. I also am careful to reverse-score items into new variables. Otherwise, we risk getting confused about whether/not items are in their original or reversed formats. Reverse-scoring the item is easily accomplished by subtracting the variable from “one plus” the scaling. Because both of these scales were on a 7-point scale, we will subtract the “NR” variablse from 8. # Reverse scoring the single item from the LGBTQ Campus Climate Scale dfSzy &lt;- dfSzy %&gt;% dplyr::mutate(unsupportive = 8 - supportiveNR) # Reversing three items on the Institutional and Goals Commitments # scale dfSzy &lt;- dfSzy %&gt;% dplyr::mutate(not_graduate = 8 - not_graduateNR) %&gt;% dplyr::mutate(undecided = 8 - undecidedNR) %&gt;% dplyr::mutate(grades_unimportant = 8 - grades_unimportantNR) Next we create scale and/or subscale scores. The sjstats::mean_n() function allows us to specify how many items (whole number) or what percentage of items should be present in order to get the mean. It is customary to require 75-80% of items to be present for scoring. Three-item variables might allow one missing (i.e., 66%). In the code below, I first make lists of the variables that belong in each scale and subscale. then I create th enew variables. # Making the list of variables LGBTQ_Climate &lt;- c(&quot;cold&quot;, &quot;unresponsive&quot;, &quot;unsupportive&quot;, &quot;negative&quot;, &quot;heterosexism&quot;, &quot;harassed&quot;) CollResponse &lt;- c(&quot;cold&quot;, &quot;unresponsive&quot;, &quot;unsupportive&quot;) Stigma &lt;- c(&quot;negative&quot;, &quot;heterosexism&quot;, &quot;harassed&quot;) Victimization &lt;- c(&quot;Vic1&quot;, &quot;Vic2&quot;, &quot;Vic3&quot;, &quot;Vic4&quot;, &quot;Vic5&quot;, &quot;Vic6&quot;, &quot;Vic7&quot;, &quot;Vic8&quot;, &quot;Vic9&quot;) CampSat &lt;- c(&quot;Sat1&quot;, &quot;Sat2&quot;, &quot;Sat3&quot;, &quot;Sat4&quot;, &quot;Sat5&quot;) Persist &lt;- c(&quot;graduation_importance&quot;, &quot;right_decision&quot;, &quot;will_register&quot;, &quot;not_graduate&quot;, &quot;undecided&quot;, &quot;grades_unimportant&quot;) GAD7 &lt;- c(&quot;nervous&quot;, &quot;worry_control&quot;, &quot;much_worry&quot;, &quot;cant_relax&quot;, &quot;restless&quot;, &quot;irritable&quot;, &quot;afraid&quot;) PHQ9 &lt;- c(&quot;anhedonia&quot;, &quot;down&quot;, &quot;sleep&quot;, &quot;lo_energy&quot;, &quot;appetite&quot;, &quot;selfworth&quot;, &quot;concentration&quot;, &quot;too_slowfast&quot;, &quot;s_ideation&quot;) # Creating the new variables dfSzy$LGBTQclimate &lt;- sjstats::mean_n(dfSzy[, LGBTQ_Climate], 0.75) dfSzy$CollegeRx &lt;- sjstats::mean_n(dfSzy[, CollResponse], 0.66) dfSzy$Stigma &lt;- sjstats::mean_n(dfSzy[, Stigma], 0.66) dfSzy$Victimization &lt;- sjstats::mean_n(dfSzy[, Victimization], 0.8) dfSzy$CampusSat &lt;- sjstats::mean_n(dfSzy[, CampSat], 0.75) dfSzy$Persistence &lt;- sjstats::mean_n(dfSzy[, Persist], 0.8) dfSzy$Anxiety &lt;- sjstats::mean_n(dfSzy[, GAD7], 0.75) dfSzy$Depression &lt;- sjstats::mean_n(dfSzy[, PHQ9], 0.8) # If the scoring code above does not work for you, try the format # below which involves inserting to periods in front of the variable # list.

M and SD are used to represent mean and standard deviation, respectively. Values in square brackets indicate the 95% confidence interval. The confidence interval is a plausible range of population correlations that could have caused the sample correlation (Cumming, 2014). * indicates p &lt; .05. ** indicates p &lt; .01. Examination of these values follow some expected patterns. First, the LGBTQ climate score (i.e., the total scale score) is highly correlated with each of its subscales (College Response r = .83, p &lt; 0.01; Stigma r = .83, p = 0.01). These strong correlations are somewhat misleading because half of the items on the total scale are the same items on each of the subscales. The correlation between the two subscales is still statistically significant, but much lower (r = 0.37, p = 0.01). Convergent and discriminant validity are of interest when we compare the LGBTQ Climate total scale score and the College Response and Stigma subscales with the additional measures. Regarding the total LGBTQ Climate score, a very strong correlation was observed with campus satisfaction (r = -0.49, p &lt; 0.01); less strong correlations were observed with and persistence (r = -0.21, p &lt; 0.01), anxiety (r = 0.17, p &lt; 0.01), and depression (r = 0.18, p &lt; 0.01). Recalling that higher scores on the LGBTQ Campus Climate score indicate a negative climate, we see that as the LGBTQ campus climate becomes increasingly stigmatizing and nonresponsive, students experience lower overall campus satisfaction and are less likely to persist at that institution. The correlation between LGBTQ Campus Climate and victimization was non-significant (r = 0.01, p &gt; 0.05). In assessing patterns of convergent and discriminant validity, the researcher would also take the time to map out the subscales (i.e., College Response, Stigma) with the additional measures. 4.4.8.1 Determing Statistically Significant Differences Between Correlations Without a formal test, it is inappropriate for researchers to declare that one correlation is stronger than another. The package cocor allows the comparisons of dependent (i.e., all respondents are from the same sample) and independent (i.e., correlations are compared between two different samples) where the correlations themselves can be overlapping (i.e., with one common variable) or non-overlapping (i.e., the variables in both correlations are different). Because all of the correlations we computed are within the same sample, they are dependent. When assessing convergent and discriminant validity it is common to ask if the correlations between the additional measures are different between the subscales of the focal measure. Results could support the notion that the subscales are related and yet different. An example of this might be comparing the correlations between victimization with the College Response subscale (r = -.17, p &lt; 0.01) and victimization with Stigma subscale (r = 0.20, p &lt; 0.01). This test would be overlapping because the victimization variable is in common. Here’s the code: cocor::cocor(formula = ~CollegeRx + Victimization | Stigma + Victimization, data = dfSzy) Results of a comparison of two overlapping correlations based on dependent groups Comparison between r.jk (Victimization, CollegeRx) = -0.1741 and r.jh (Victimization, Stigma) = 0.2015 Difference: r.jk - r.jh = -0.3756 Related correlation: r.kh = 0.3734 Data: dfSzy: j = Victimization, k = CollegeRx, h = Stigma Group size: n = 646 Null hypothesis: r.jk is equal to r.jh Alternative hypothesis: r.jk is not equal to r.jh (two-sided) Alpha: 0.05 pearson1898: Pearson and Filon&#39;s z (1898) z = -8.9455, p-value = 0.0000 Null hypothesis rejected hotelling1940: Hotelling&#39;s t (1940) t = -9.0342, df = 643, p-value = 0.0000 Null hypothesis rejected williams1959: Williams&#39; t (1959) t = -9.0340, df = 643, p-value = 0.0000 Null hypothesis rejected olkin1967: Olkin&#39;s z (1967) z = -8.9455, p-value = 0.0000 Null hypothesis rejected dunn1969: Dunn and Clark&#39;s z (1969) z = -8.7137, p-value = 0.0000 Null hypothesis rejected hendrickson1970: Hendrickson, Stanley, and Hills&#39; (1970) modification of Williams&#39; t (1959) t = -9.0341, df = 643, p-value = 0.0000 Null hypothesis rejected steiger1980: Steiger&#39;s (1980) modification of Dunn and Clark&#39;s z (1969) using average correlations z = -8.6124, p-value = 0.0000 Null hypothesis rejected meng1992: Meng, Rosenthal, and Rubin&#39;s z (1992) z = -8.5080, p-value = 0.0000 Null hypothesis rejected 95% confidence interval for r.jk - r.jh: -0.4678 -0.2926 Null hypothesis rejected (Interval does not include 0) hittner2003: Hittner, May, and Silver&#39;s (2003) modification of Dunn and Clark&#39;s z (1969) using a backtransformed average Fisher&#39;s (1921) Z procedure z = -8.6124, p-value = 0.0000 Null hypothesis rejected zou2007: Zou&#39;s (2007) confidence interval 95% confidence interval for r.jk - r.jh: -0.4568 -0.2921 Null hypothesis rejected (Interval does not include 0) Fisher’s z-test (z = -8.6124, p &lt; 0.001) tells us that the correlations are statistically significantly different from each other; Zhou’s confidence intervals provide the CI for the size of the difference between the two correlations. That is, the difference could be as large as -0.4568 or as small as -0.2921. Another type of correlation comparison is with a the total and/or subscales, looking at the relative magnitude of their correlation with different variables. For example, we might wish to ask if the LGBTQ Campus Climate total scale is different degrees of correlation with anxiety (r = 0.17, p &lt; 0.01) and depression (r = .18, p &lt; 0.01). cocor::cocor(formula = ~LGBTQclimate + Anxiety | LGBTQclimate + Depression, data = dfSzy) Results of a comparison of two overlapping correlations based on dependent groups Comparison between r.jk (LGBTQclimate, Anxiety) = 0.1724 and r.jh (LGBTQclimate, Depression) = 0.1795 Difference: r.jk - r.jh = -0.0071 Related correlation: r.kh = 0.5387 Data: dfSzy: j = LGBTQclimate, k = Anxiety, h = Depression Group size: n = 646 Null hypothesis: r.jk is equal to r.jh Alternative hypothesis: r.jk is not equal to r.jh (two-sided) Alpha: 0.05 pearson1898: Pearson and Filon&#39;s z (1898) z = -0.1914, p-value = 0.8482 Null hypothesis retained hotelling1940: Hotelling&#39;s t (1940) t = -0.1911, df = 643, p-value = 0.8485 Null hypothesis retained williams1959: Williams&#39; t (1959) t = -0.1909, df = 643, p-value = 0.8487 Null hypothesis retained olkin1967: Olkin&#39;s z (1967) z = -0.1914, p-value = 0.8482 Null hypothesis retained dunn1969: Dunn and Clark&#39;s z (1969) z = -0.1909, p-value = 0.8486 Null hypothesis retained hendrickson1970: Hendrickson, Stanley, and Hills&#39; (1970) modification of Williams&#39; t (1959) t = -0.1911, df = 643, p-value = 0.8485 Null hypothesis retained steiger1980: Steiger&#39;s (1980) modification of Dunn and Clark&#39;s z (1969) using average correlations z = -0.1909, p-value = 0.8486 Null hypothesis retained meng1992: Meng, Rosenthal, and Rubin&#39;s z (1992) z = -0.1909, p-value = 0.8486 Null hypothesis retained 95% confidence interval for r.jk - r.jh: -0.0825 0.0678 Null hypothesis retained (Interval includes 0) hittner2003: Hittner, May, and Silver&#39;s (2003) modification of Dunn and Clark&#39;s z (1969) using a backtransformed average Fisher&#39;s (1921) Z procedure z = -0.1909, p-value = 0.8486 Null hypothesis retained zou2007: Zou&#39;s (2007) confidence interval 95% confidence interval for r.jk - r.jh: -0.0798 0.0656 Null hypothesis retained (Interval includes 0) Fisher’s z-test (z = -0.1909, p = 0.8486) tells us that the correlations are not statistically significantly different from each other; Zhou’s confidence intervals indicate that the differences range between -0.0798 and 0.0656. Because this interval crosses zero, we know that the difference could be zero, or reversed in direction. 4.4.8.2 Multitrait-Multimethod Matrix The multitrait-multimethod matrix is a systematic experimental design for the dual approach of convergent and discriminant validation, which requires the assessment of two or more traits (classically, math, English, and reading scores) by two more methods (self, parent, and teacher). Conducting a web-based image search on this term will show a matrix of alpha coefficients and correlation coefficients that are interpreted in relationship to each other. Roughly: alpha coefficients (internal consistency) should be the highest, validity coefficients (correlations of the same trait assessed by different methods) should be higher than correlations between different traits measured by different methods, validity coefficients (correlations of the same trait assessed by different methods) should be higher than different traits measured by the same method. 4.4.9 Incremental Validity Incremental validity is the increase in predictive validity attributable to the test. It indicates the contribution the test makes to the selection of individuals who will meet the minimum standards in criterion performance. There are different ways to assess this – one of the most common is to first enter known predictors and then see if the instrument-of-interest continues to account variance over-and-above those that are entered. In the Szymanski and Bissonette (2020) psychometric evaluation, the negative relations with satisfaction with college and intention to persist in college as well as positive relations with both anxiety and depression persisted even after controlling for LGBTQ victimization experiences. I will demonstrate this procedure, predicting the contribution that the LGBTQ Campus Climate total scale score has on predicting intention to persist in college, over and above LGBTQ victimization. The process is to use hierarchical linear regression. Two models are built. In the first mode (“PfV” stands [in my mind] for “Persistence from Victimization”), persistence is predicted from victimization. The second model adds the LGBTQ Campus Climate Scale. I asked for summaries of each model. Then the anova() function compares the model.

Messick’s point was to consider the the unintended consequences of specific uses. That is, their use may be detrimental to individuals or to members of certain ethnic or other populations with diverse experiential backgrounds. Examples of inappropriate use have included: The California Psychological Inventory (CPI) being used as a screening tool for employment as a security job. Two of its items inquired about same-sex activities and the employer was using this to screen out gay men. Applicants were able to demonstrate, in court, a consistent rejection of gay applicants. While this is not a psychological test, urine samples are often collected as drug screening tools. In reality, urine can reveal a number of things, such as pregnancy. The issue begs “conflicting goals.” In this case, the problem was not caused by the test but rather by its misuse. Studying the “consequences” of testing is one that is not necessarily answerable by empirical data/statistical analysis. It requires critical observation, human judgment, and systematic debate. 4.5 Factors Affecting Validity Coefficients Keeping in mind that a validity coefficient is merely the correlation between the test and some criteria, the same elements that impact the magnitude and significance of a correlation coefficient will similarly effect a validity coefficient. Nature of the group. A test that has high validity in predicting a particular criterion in one population, may have little or no validity in predicting the same criterion in another population. If a test is designed for use in diverse populations, information about the population generalizability should be reported in the technical manuals. Sample heterogeneity. Other things being equal, if there is a linear relationship between X and Y, it will have a greater magnitude when the sample is heterogeneous. Pre-selection. Just like internal and external validity in a research design can be threatened by selection issues, pre-selection can also impact the validity coefficients of a measure. For example, if we are evaluating a new test for job selection, we may select a group of newly hired employees. We plan to collect some measure of job performance at a later date. Our results may be limited by the criteria used to select the employees. Were they volunteers? Were they only those hired? Were they ALL of the applicants? Validity coefficients may change over time. Consider the relationship between the college boards and grade point average at Yale University. Fifty years ago, \\(r_{xy} = .72\\); today \\(r_{xy} = .52\\). Why? The nature of the student body has become more diverse (50 years ago, the student body was predominantly White, high SES, and male). The form of the relationship matters. The Pearson R assumes the relationship between the predictor and criterion variables is linear, uniform, and homoschedastistic (equal variability throughout the range of a bivariate distribution). When the variability is unequal throughout the range of the distribution the relationship is heteroscedastic. Figure 4.1: Illustration of heteroschedasticity There could also be other factors involved in the relationship between the instrument and the criterion: curvilinearity an undetected mechanism, such as a moderator Finally, what is our threshold for acceptability? Consider statistical signifance – but also its limitations (e.g., power, Type I error, Type II error) Consider the magnitude of the correlation; and also \\(R^2\\) (the proportion of variance accounted for) Consider error: The standard error of the estimate shows the margin of error to be expected in the individuals predicted criterion score as the result of the imperfect validity of the instrument. \\[SE_{est} = SD_{y}\\sqrt{1 - r_{xy}^{2}}\\] Where \\(r_{xy}^{2}\\) is the square of the validity coefficient \\(SD_{y}\\) is the standard deviation of the criterion scores If the validity were perfect (\\(r_{xy}^{2}\\) = 1.00), the error of estimate would be 0.00. If the validity were zero, the error of estimate would equal \\(SD_{y}\\). Interpreting \\(SE_{est}\\) If \\(r_{xy}\\) = .80, then \\(\\sqrt{1 - r_{xy}^{2}} = .60\\) Error is 60% as large as it would be by chance.Stated another way, predicting an individual’s criterion performance has a margin of error that is 40% smaller than it would be by chance. To obtain the \\(SE_{est}\\), we merely multiply by the \\(SD_{y}\\). This puts error in the metric of the criterion variable. Your Turn If \\(r_{xy}\\) = .25, then \\(\\sqrt{1 - r_{xy}^{2}} =\\) ?? Make a statement about chance. Make a statement about margin of error. 4.6 Practice Problems In each of these lessons, I provide suggestions for practice that allow you to select one or more problems that are graded in difficulty. With each of these options, I encourage you to interpret examine aspects of the construct validity through the creation and interpretation of validity coefficients. Ideally, you will examine both convergent/discriminant validity as well as incremental validity. 4.6.1 Problem #1: Play around with this simulation. Copy the script for the simulation and then change (at least) one thing in the simulation to see how it impacts the results. If calculating is new to you, perhaps you just change the number in “set.seed(210907)” from 210907 to something else. Your results should parallel those obtained in the lecture, making it easier for you to check your work as you go. 4.6.2 Problem #2: Conduct the reliability analysis selecting different variables. The Szymanski and Bissonette (2020) article conducted a handful of incremental validity assessments. Select different outcome variables (e.g., depression) and/or use the subscales as the instrument-of-interest. 4.6.3 Problem #3: Try something entirely new. Using data for which you have permission and access (e.g., IRB approved data you have collected or from your lab; data you simulate from a published article; data from an open science repository; data from other chapters in this OER), create validity coefficients and use three variables to estimate the incremental validity of the instrument-of-interest. 4.6.4 Grading Rubric Assignment Component Points Possible Points Earned 1.

As a brief review, this data is part of an IRB-approved study, with consent to use in teaching demonstrations and to be made available to the general public via the open science framework. Hence, it is appropriate to use in this context. You will notice there are student- and teacher- IDs. These numbers are not actual student and teacher IDs, rather they were further re-identified so that they could not be connected to actual people. Because this is an actual dataset, if you wish to work the problem along with me, you will need to download the ReC.rds data file from the Worked_Examples folder in the ReC_Psychometrics project on the GitHub. The course evaluation items can be divided into three subscales: Valued by the student includes the items: ValObjectives, IncrUnderstanding, IncrInterest Traditional pedagogy includes the items: ClearResponsibilities, EffectiveAnswers, Feedback, ClearOrganization, ClearPresentation Socially responsive pedagogy includes the items: InclusvClassrm, EquitableEval, MultPerspectives, DEIintegration In this homework focused on validity we will score the total scale and subscales, create a correlation matrix of our scales with a different scale (or item), formally test to see if correlation coefficients are statistically significantly different from each other, conduct a test of incremental validity. 4.7.1 Check and, if needed, format data big &lt;- readRDS(&quot;ReC.rds&quot;) Let’s check the structure… str(big) Classes &#39;data.table&#39; and &#39;data.frame&#39;: 310 obs. of 33 variables: $ deID : int 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... $ CourseID : int 57085635 57085635 57085635 57085635 57085635 57085635 57085635 57085635 57085635 57085635 ... $ Dept : chr &quot;CPY&quot; &quot;CPY&quot; &quot;CPY&quot; &quot;CPY&quot; ... $ Course : Factor w/ 3 levels &quot;Psychometrics&quot;,..: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ... $ StatsPkg : Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;SPSS&quot;,&quot;R&quot;: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ... $ Centering : Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;Pre&quot;,&quot;Re&quot;: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ... $ Year : int 2021 2021 2021 2021 2021 2021 2021 2021 2021 2021 ... $ Quarter : chr &quot;Fall&quot; &quot;Fall&quot; &quot;Fall&quot; &quot;Fall&quot; ... $ IncrInterest : int 5 3 4 2 4 3 5 3 2 5 ... $ IncrUnderstanding : int 2 3 4 3 4 4 5 2 4 5 ... $ ValObjectives : int 5 5 4 4 5 5 5 5 4 5 ... $ ApprAssignments : int 5 4 4 4 5 3 5 3 3 5 ... $ EffectiveAnswers : int 5 3 5 3 5 3 4 3 2 3 ... $ Respectful : int 5 5 4 5 5 4 5 4 5 5 ... $ ClearResponsibilities : int 5 5 4 4 5 4 5 4 4 5 ... $ Feedback : int 5 3 4 2 5 NA 5 4 4 5 ... $ OvInstructor : int 5 4 4 3 5 3 5 4 3 5 ... $ MultPerspectives : int 5 5 4 5 5 4 5 5 5 5 ... $ OvCourse : int 3 4 4 3 5 3 5 3 2 5 ... $ InclusvClassrm : int 5 5 5 5 5 4 5 5 4 5 ... $ DEIintegration : int 5 5 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 5 ... $ ClearPresentation : int 4 4 4 2 5 3 4 4 4 5 ... $ ApprWorkload : int 5 5 3 4 4 2 5 4 4 5 ... $ MyContribution : int 4 4 4 4 5 4 4 3 4 5 ... $ InspiredInterest : int 5 3 4 3 5 3 5 4 4 5 ... $ Faith : int 5 NA 4 2 NA NA 4 4 4 NA ... $ EquitableEval : int 5 5 3 5 5 3 5 5 3 5 ... $ SPFC.Decolonize.Opt.Out: chr &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot; ... $ ProgramYear : Factor w/ 3 levels &quot;Second&quot;,&quot;Transition&quot;,..: 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ... $ ClearOrganization : int 3 4 3 4 4 4 5 4 4 5 ... $ RegPrepare : int 5 4 4 4 4 3 4 4 4 5 ... $ EffectiveLearning : int 2 4 3 4 4 2 5 3 2 5 ... $ AccessibleInstructor : int 5 4 4 4 5 4 5 4 5 5 ... - attr(*, &quot;.internal.selfref&quot;)=&lt;externalptr&gt; We will need to create the three subscales.

However, I didn’t include the “Overall Instructor” (OvInstructor) in any of the items, so we could think of it as a way to look at convergent and discriminant validity. apaTables::apa.cor.table(big[c(&quot;Valued&quot;, &quot;TradPed&quot;, &quot;SRPed&quot;, &quot;OvInstructor&quot;)], filename = &quot;ReC_cortable.doc&quot;, table.number = 1, show.sig.stars = TRUE, landscape = TRUE) Table 1 Means, standard deviations, and correlations with confidence intervals Variable M SD 1 2 3 1.

All the correlations are strong and positive, but look at the correlation between Overall Instructor and SCRPed! 4.7.3 With convergent and discriminant validity in mind, interpret the validity coefficients; this should include an assessment about whether the correlation coefficients (at least two different pairings) are statistically significantly different from each other. We need to see if these correlations are statistically significantly different from each other. I am interested in knowing if the correlations between Overall Instructor and each of the three course dimensions (Valued [r = 0.63, p &lt; 0.01], TradPed [r = 0.80, p &lt; 0.01], SRPed [r = 0.67, p &lt;

We start by defining classical test theory and examiningg several forms of reliability. While the majority of our time is spent considering estimates of internal consistency, we also revoew retest reliability and inter-rater reliability. 5.1 Navigating this Lesson There is one hour and twenty minutes of lecture. If you work through the materials with me, plan for an additional hour. While the majority of R objects and data you will need are created within the R script that sources the chapter, occasionally there are some that cannot be created from within the R framework. Additionally, sometimes links fail. All original materials are provided at the Github site that hosts the book. More detailed guidelines for ways to access all these materials are provided in the OER’s introduction 5.1.1 Learning Objectives Focusing on this week’s materials, make sure you can: Define “reliability.” Identify broad classes of reliability. Interpret reliability coefficients. Describe the strengths and limitations of the alpha coefficient. 5.1.2 Planning for Practice In each of these lessons I provide suggestions for practice that allow you to select one or more problems that are graded in difficulty. The least complex is to change the random seed in the research and rework the problem demonstrated in the lesson. The results should map onto the ones obtained in the lecture. The second option involves utilizing one of the simulated datasets available in this OER. The last lesson in the OER contains three simulations that could be used for all of the statistics-based practice suggestions. Especially if you started with one of these examples in an earlier lesson, I highly recommend you continue with that. Alternatively, Lewis and Neville’s (2015) Gendered Racial Microaggressions Scale for Black Women will be used in the lessons on exploratory factor analysis; Keum et al.’s Gendered Racial Microaggressions Scale for Asian American Women (Keum et al., 2018) will be used in the lessons on confirmatory factor analysis; and Conover et al.’s (2017) Ableist Microaggressions Scale is used in the lesson on invariance testing. Any of these would be suitable for the PCA and PAF homework assignments. As a third option, you are welcome to use data to which you have access and is suitable for PCA. In any case, please select a scale that has item-level data for which there is a theorized total scale score as well as two or more subscales (three subscales is ideal). With each of these options, plan to: Format (i.e., rescore, if necessary) a dataset so that it is possible to calculates estimates of internal consistency Calculate and report the alpha coefficient for a total scale scores and subscales (if the scale has them) Calculate and report \\(\\omega_{t}\\) and \\(\\omega_{h}\\). With these two determine what proportion of the variance is due to all the factors, error, and g. Calculate total and subscale scores. Describe other reliability estimates that would be appropriate for the measure you are evaluating. 5.1.3 Readings &amp; Resources In preparing this chapter, I drew heavily from the following resource(s).

Therefore, the mean of measurement errors for any individual (upon numerous repeated testings) would be zero. That said, in CTT, the true score would be equal to the mean of the observed scores over an indefinite number of repeated measures. Caveat: this is based on the assumption that when individuals are repeatedly measured, their true scores remain unchanged. In classic test theory, true score can be estimated over multiple trials. However, if errors are systematically biased, the true score will remain unknown. 5.2.2 Why are we concerned with reliability? Error! Measurements are imperfect and every observation has some unknown amount of error associated with it. There are two components in error: random/unsystematic: varies in unpredictable and inconsistent ways upon repeated measurements; sources are unknown systematic: recurs upon repeated measurements reflecting situational or individual effects that, theoretically, could be specified. Correlations are attenuated (i.e., smaller than) from the true correlation if the observations contain error. Knowing the reliability of an instruments allows us to: estimate the degree to which measured at one time and place with one instrument predict scores at another time and/or place and perhaps measured with a different instrument estimate the consistency of scores estimate “…the degree to which test scores are free from errors of measurement” (APA, 1985, p. 19) Figure 7.1a in Revelle’s chapter illustrates the attentuation of the correlation between the variables p and q as a function of reliabilty. circles (latent variables [LV]) represent the true score observed/measured/manifest variables are represented by squares and each has an associated error; not illustrated are the random and systematic components of error a true score is composed of a measured variable and its error the relationship between the true scores would be stronger than the one between the measured variables moving to 7.1b in Revelle’s chapter, the correlation between LV p and the observed ’’ can be estimated from the correlation of p’ with a parallel test (this is the reliability piece) Figure 7.2 in Revelle’s Chapter 7 (n.d.) illustrates the conceptual effect of reliability on the estimation of a true score. The figure is meant to demonstrate that when error variances are small and reliability is greater, the variance of the true scores more closely approximates that of observed scores. 5.2.3 The Reliability Coefficient The symbol for reliability, \\(r_{xx}\\), sums up the big-picture definition that reliability is the correlation of a measure with itself. There are a number of ways to think about it: a “theoretical validity” of a measure because it refers to a relationship between observed scores and scores on a latent variable or construct, represents the fraction of an observed score variance that is not error, ranges from 0-1 1, when all observed variance is due to true-score variance; there are no random errors, 0, when all observed variance is due to random errors of measurement, represents the squared correlation between observed scores and true scores, the ratio between true-score variance and observed-score variance (for a formulaic rendition see (Pedhazur &amp; Schmelkin, 1991)), \\[r_{xt}^{2}=r_{xx} =\\frac{\\sigma_{2}^{t}}{\\sigma_{2}^{x}}\\] where \\(r_{xt}^{2}\\) is the proportion of variance between observed scores (t + e) and true scores (t); its square root is the correlation \\(r_{xx}\\) is the reliability of a measure \\({\\sigma_{2}^{t}}\\) is the variance of true scores \\({\\sigma_{2}^{x}}\\) is the variance of observed scores The reliability coefficient is interpreted as the proportion of systematic variance in the observed score. .8 means that 80% of the variance of the observed scores is systematic; .2 (e.g., 1.00 - .8)is the proportion of variance due to random errors; the reliability coefficient is population specific. To restate the first portion of the formula: although reliability is expressed as a correlation between observed scores, it is also the ratio of reliable variance to total variance. 5.3 Research Vignette The research vignette for this lesson is the development and psychometric evaluation of the Perceptions of the LGBTQ College Campus Climate Scale (Szymanski &amp; Bissonette, 2020). The scale is six items with responses rated on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Higher scores indicate more negative perceptions of the LGBTQ campus climate. Szymanski and Bissonette (2020) have suggested that the psychometric evaluation supports using the scale in its entirety or as subscales. Each item is listed below with its variable name in parentheses: College response to LGBTQ students: My university/college is cold and uncaring toward LGBTQ students. (cold) My university/college is unresponsive to the needs of LGBTQ students. (unresponsive) My university/college provides a supportive environment for LGBTQ students. (unsupportive) this item must be reverse-scored LGBTQ Stigma: Negative attitudes toward LGBTQ persons are openly expressed on my university/college campus. (negative) Heterosexism, homophobia, biphobia, transphobia, and cissexism are visible on my university/college campus. (heterosexism) LGBTQ students are harassed on my university/college campus. (harassed) A preprint of the article is available at ResearchGate. Below is the script for simulating item-level data from the factor loadings, means, and sample size presented in the published article. Because data is collected at the item level (and I want this resource to be as practical as possible, I have simulated the data for each of the scales at the item level. Simulating the data involved using factor loadings, means, and correlations between the scales. Because the simulation will produce “out-of-bounds” values, the code below rescales the scores into the range of the Likert-type scaling and rounds them to whole values. Five additional scales were reported in the Szymanski and Bissonette article (2020). Unfortunately, I could not locate factor loadings for all of them; and in two cases, I used estimates from a more recent psychometric analysis. When the individual item and their factor loadings are known, I assigned names based on item content (e.g., “lo_energy”) rather than using item numbers (e.g., “PHQ4”). When I am doing psychometric analyses, I prefer item-level names so that I can quickly see (without having to look up the item names) how the items are behaving. While the focus of this series of chapters is on the LGBTQ Campus Climate scale, this simulated data might be useful to you in one or more of the suggestions for practice (e.g., examining the psychometric characteristics of one or the other scales). The scales, their original citation, and information about how I simulated data for each are listed below. Sexual Orientation-Based Campus Victimization Scale (Herek, 1993) is a 9-item item scale with Likert scaling ranging from 0 (never) to 3 (two or more times). Because I was not able to locate factor loadings from a psychometric evaluation, I simulated the data by specifying a 0.8 as a standardized factor loading for each of the items. College Satisfaction Scale (Helm et al., 1998) is a 5-item scale with Likert scaling ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Higher scores represent greater college satisfaction. Because I was not able to locate factor loadings from a psychometric evaluation, I simulated the data by specifying a 0.8 as a standardized factor loading for each of the items. Institutional and Goals Commitment (Pascarella &amp; Terenzini, 1980) is a 6-item subscale from a 35-item measure assessing academic/social integration and institutional/goal commitment (5 subscales total). The measure had with Likert scaling ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Higher scores on the institutional and goals commitment subscale indicate greater intentions to persist in college. Data were simulated using factor loadings in the source article. GAD-7 (Spitzer et al., 2006) is a 7-item scale with Likert scaling ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). Higher scores indicate more anxiety. I simulated data by estimating factor loadings from Brattmyr et al. (2022). PHQ-9 (Kroenke et al., 2001) is a 9-item scale with Likert scaling ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). Higher scores indicate higher levels of depression. I simulated data by estimating factor loadings from Brattmyr et al. (2022). #Entering the intercorrelations, means, and standard deviations from the journal article Szymanski_generating_model &lt;- &#39; #measurement model CollegeResponse =~ .88*cold + .73*unresponsive + .73*supportive Stigma =~ .86*negative + .76*heterosexism + .71*harassed Victimization =~ .8*Vic1 + .8*Vic2 + .8*Vic3 + .8*Vic4 + .8*Vic5 + .8*Vic6 + .8*Vic7 + .8*Vic8 + .8*Vic9 CollSat =~ .8*Sat1 + .8*Sat2 + .8*Sat3 + .8*Sat4 + .8*Sat5 Persistence =~ .69*graduation_importance + .63*right_decision + .62*will_register + .59*not_graduate + .45*undecided + .44*grades_unimportant Anxiety =~ .851*nervous + .887*worry_control + .894*much_worry + 674*cant_relax + .484*restless + .442*irritable + 716*afraid Depression =~ .798*anhedonia + .425*down + .591*sleep + .913*lo_energy + .441*appetite + .519*selfworth + .755*concentration + .454*too_slowfast + .695*s_ideation #Means CollegeResponse ~ 2.71*1 Stigma ~3.61*1 Victimization ~ 0.11*1 CollSat ~ 5.61*1 Persistence ~ 4.41*1 Anxiety ~ 1.45*1 Depression ~1.29*1 #Correlations CollegeResponse ~~ .58*Stigma CollegeResponse ~~ -.25*Victimization CollegeResponse ~~ -.59*CollSat CollegeResponse ~~ -.29*Persistence CollegeResponse ~~ .17*Anxiety CollegeResponse ~~ .18*Depression Stigma ~~ .37*Victimization Stigma ~~ -.41*CollSat Stigma ~~ -.19*Persistence Stigma ~~ .27*Anxiety Stigma ~~ .24*Depression Victimization ~~ -.22*CollSat Victimization ~~ -.04*Persistence Victimization ~~ .23*Anxiety Victimization ~~ .21*Depression CollSat ~~ .53*Persistence CollSat ~~ -.29*Anxiety CollSat ~~ -.32*Depression Persistence ~~ -.22*Anxiety Persistence ~~ -.26*Depression Anxiety ~~ .76*Depression &#39; set.seed(240218) dfSzy &lt;- lavaan::simulateData(model = Szymanski_generating_model, model.type = &quot;sem&quot;, meanstructure = T, sample.nobs=646, standardized=FALSE) #used to retrieve column indices used in the rescaling script below col_index &lt;- as.data.frame(colnames(dfSzy)) #The code below loops through each column of the dataframe and assigns the scaling accordingly #Rows 1 thru 6 are the Perceptions of LGBTQ Campus Climate Scale #Rows 7 thru 15 are the Sexual Orientation-Based Campus Victimization Scale #Rows 16 thru 20 are the College Satisfaction Scale #Rows 21 thru 26 are the Institutional and Goals Commitment Scale #Rows 27 thru 33 are the GAD7 #Rows 34 thru 42 are the PHQ9 for(i in 1:ncol(dfSzy)){ if(i &gt;= 1 &amp; i &lt;= 6){ dfSzy[,i] &lt;- scales::rescale(dfSzy[,i], c(1, 7)) } if(i &gt;= 7 &amp; i &lt;= 15){ dfSzy[,i] &lt;- scales::rescale(dfSzy[,i], c(0, 3)) } if(i &gt;= 16 &amp; i &lt;= 20){ dfSzy[,i] &lt;- scales::rescale(dfSzy[,i], c(1, 7)) } if(i &gt;= 21 &amp; i &lt;= 26){ dfSzy[,i] &lt;- scales::rescale(dfSzy[,i], c(1, 5)) } if(i &gt;= 27 &amp; i &lt;= 33){ dfSzy[,i] &lt;- scales::rescale(dfSzy[,i], c(0, 3)) } if(i &gt;= 34 &amp; i &lt;= 42){ dfSzy[,i] &lt;- scales::rescale(dfSzy[,i], c(0, 3)) } } #rounding to integers so that the data resembles that which was collected library(tidyverse) dfSzy &lt;- dfSzy %&gt;% round(0) #quick check of my work #psych::describe(dfSzy) #Reversing the supportive item on the Perceptions of LGBTQ Campus Climate Scale so that the exercises will be consistent with the format in which the data was collected dfSzy &lt;- dfSzy %&gt;% dplyr::mutate(supportiveNR = 8 - supportive) #Reversing three items on the Institutional and Goals Commitments scale so that the exercises will be consistent with the format in which the data was collected dfSzy &lt;- dfSzy %&gt;% dplyr::mutate(not_graduateNR = 8 - not_graduate)%&gt;% dplyr::mutate(undecidedNR = 8 - undecided)%&gt;% dplyr::mutate(grades_unimportantNR = 8 - grades_unimportant) dfSzy &lt;- dplyr::select(dfSzy, -c(supportive, not_graduate, undecided, grades_unimportant)) The optional script below will let you save the simulated data to your computing environment as either an .rds object (preserves any formatting you might do) or a.csv file (think “Excel lite”). # to save the df as an .rds (think &#39;R object&#39;) file on your computer; # it should save in the same file as the .rmd file you are working # with saveRDS(dfSzy, &#39;SzyDF.rds&#39;) bring back the simulated dat from # an .rds file dfSzy &lt;- readRDS(&#39;SzyDF.rds&#39;) # write the simulated data as a .csv write.table(dfSzy, # file=&#39;SzyDF.csv&#39;, sep=&#39;,&#39;, col.names=TRUE, row.names=FALSE) bring # back the simulated dat from a .csv file dfSzy &lt;- # read.csv(&#39;SzyDF.csv&#39;, header = TRUE) If we look at the information about this particular scale, we recognize that the supportive item is scaled in the opposite direction of the rest of the items. That is, a higher score on supportive would indicate a positive perception of the campus climate for LGBTQ individuals, whereas higher scores on the remaining items indicate a more negative perception. Before moving forward, we must reverse score this item. In this psychometrics example I have given my variables one-word names that represent each item. Many researchers (including myself) will often give variable names that are alpha numerical: LGBTQ1, LGBTQ2, LGBTQn. In the psychometric evaluations, the one-word names may be useful shortcuts as one begins to understand the inter-item relations. In reverse-scoring the supportive item, I will rename it “unsupportive” as an indication of its reversed direction. library(tidyverse) dfSzy &lt;- dfSzy %&gt;% dplyr::mutate(unsupportive = 8 - supportiveNR) #when reverse-coding, subtract the variable from one number higher than the scaling # When unhashtagged, this code provides item-level descriptive # statistics psych::describe(dfSzy) Next, I will create dfs that each contain the items of the total and subscales. These will be useful in the reliability estimates that follow. Note that I am adding “T1” (time 1) to the end of the variable names. Later in the lesson when we evaluate test-retest reliability, we will simulate and add a “T2. LGBTQT1 &lt;- dplyr::select(dfSzy, cold, unresponsive, unsupportive, negative, heterosexism, harassed) ResponseT1 &lt;- dplyr::select(dfSzy, cold, unresponsive, unsupportive) StigmaT1 &lt;- dplyr::select(dfSzy, negative, heterosexism, harassed) As we move into the lecture, allow me to provide a content advisory. Individuals who hold LGBTQIA+ identities are frequently the recipients of discrimination and harassment. If you are curious about why these items are considered to be stigmatizing or non-responsive, please do not ask a member of the LGBTQIA+ community to explain it to you; it is not their job to educate others on discrimination, harassment, and microaggressions. Rather, please read the article in its entirety. Additionally, resources such as The Trevor Project, GLSEN, and Campus Pride are credible sources of information for learning more. 5.4 A Parade of Reliability Coefficients While I cluster the reliability coefficients into large groups, please understand that these are somewhat overlapping. Table 1 in Revelle and Condon’s (2019a) article provides a summary of of the type of reliability tested, the findings, and the function used in the psych package. 5.4.1 Reliability Options for a Single Administration If reliability is defined as the correlation between a test and a test just like it, how do we estimate the reliability of a single test, given only one time (Revelle &amp; Condon, 2019a)? It may help to keep in mind that reliability is the ratio of true score variance to test score variance (or 1 - the ratio of error variance). Thus, the goal is to estimate the amount of error variance in the test. In this case we can investigate: a correlation between two random parts of the test internal consistency the internal structure of the test 5.4.1.1 Split-half reliability Split-half reliability is splitting a test into two random halves, correlating the two halves, and adjusting the correlation with the Spearman-Brown prophecy formula. Abundant formulaic detail in Revelle’s Chapter 7/Reliability (n.d.). An important question to split-half is “How to split?” Revelle terms it a “combinatorially difficult problem.” There are 126 possible splits for a 10 item scale; 6,345 possible splits for a 16 item scale; and over 4.5 billion for a 36 item scale! The psych package’s splitHalf() function will try all possible splits for scales of up to 16 items, then sample 10,000 splits for scales longer than that. split &lt;- psych::splitHalf(LGBTQT1, raw = TRUE, brute = TRUE) split #show the results of the analysis Split half reliabilities Call: psych::splitHalf(r = LGBTQT1, raw = TRUE, brute = TRUE) Maximum split half reliability (lambda 4) = 0.73 Guttman lambda 6 = 0.68 Average split half reliability = 0.7 Guttman lambda 3 (alpha) = 0.7 Guttman lambda 2 = 0.71 Minimum split half reliability (beta) = 0.54 Average interitem r = 0.28 with median = 0.25 2.5% 50% 97.5% Quantiles of split half reliability = 0.54 0.72 0.73 hist(split$raw, breaks = 101, xlab = &quot;Split-half reliability&quot;, main = &quot;Split-half reliabilities of 6 LGBTQ items&quot;) Results of the split-half can provide some indication of whether not the scale is unidimensional. In this case, the maximum reliability coefficient is 0.73, the average 0.70, and the lowest is 0.54. Similarly, we can examine the quantiles: 0.54, 0.72, 0.73. The split-half output also includes the classic Cronbach’s (1951) alpha coefficient (0.70; aka Guttman lambda 3) and average interitem correlations (0.25). The figure plots the frequencies of the reliability coefficient values. While I did not find guidelines on what constitutes a “high enough lower bound” to establish homogeneity, Revelle suggested that a scale with 0.85, 0.80, and 0.65 had “strong evidence for a relatively homogeneous scale.” When the values were 0.81, 0.73, 0.42, Revelle indicated that there was “strong evidence for non-homogeneity” (Revelle &amp; Condon, 2019b, p. 11). In making this declaration, Revelle was also looking at the strength of the inter-item correlation and for a rather tight, bell-shaped, distribution at the higher (&gt; 0.73) end of the figure. What happens when we examine the split-half estimates of the subscales? With only three items, there’s not much of a split and so the associated histogram will not be helpful. splitRx &lt;- psych::splitHalf(ResponseT1, raw = TRUE, brute = TRUE) splitRx #show the results of the analysis Split half reliabilities Call: psych::splitHalf(r = ResponseT1, raw = TRUE, brute = TRUE) Maximum split half reliability (lambda 4) = 0.62 Guttman lambda 6 = 0.57 Average split half reliability = 0.59 Guttman lambda 3 (alpha) = 0.66 Guttman lambda 2 = 0.66 Minimum split half reliability (beta) = 0.56 Average interitem r = 0.39 with median = 0.4 2.5% 50% 97.5% Quantiles of split half reliability = 0.57 0.58 0.62 hist(splitRx$raw, breaks = 101, xlab = &quot;Split-half reliability&quot;, main = &quot;Split-half reliabilities of 3 items of the College Response subscale&quot;) The alpha is 0.66. The range of splits for max, ave, and low are 0.62, 0.59, and 0.55 and the quantiles are 0.57, 0.58, 0.62. The inter-item correlations have an average of 0.40. Let’s look at the split-half reliability coefficients for the Stigma subscale. splitSt &lt;- psych::splitHalf(StigmaT1, raw = TRUE, brute = TRUE) splitSt #show the results of the analysis Split half reliabilities Call: psych::splitHalf(r = StigmaT1, raw = TRUE, brute = TRUE) Maximum split half reliability (lambda 4) = 0.56 Guttman lambda 6 = 0.53 Average split half reliability = 0.56 Guttman lambda 3 (alpha) = 0.63 Guttman lambda 2 = 0.63 Minimum split half reliability (beta) = 0.55 Average interitem r = 0.36 with median = 0.36 2.5% 50% 97.5% Quantiles of split half reliability = 0.55 0.56 0.56 hist(splitRx$raw, breaks = 101, xlab = &quot;Split-half reliability&quot;, main = &quot;Split-half reliabilities of 3 items of the Stigma subscale&quot;) The alpha of this subscale is lower than the total scale score \\((\\alpha = 0.60\\)). The maximum, average, and minimum split-half reliabilities were 0.56, 0.56, and 0.55; quantiles were at 0.55, 0.56, and 0.56. The average interitem correlation was 0.36. Because the alpha coefficient can be defined as the “average of all possible split-half coefficients” for the groups tested, it is common for researchers to not provide split-half results in their papers – this is true for our research vignette. I continue to teach the split-half because it can be a stepping stone in the conceptualization of internal consistency as an estimate of reliability. 5.4.1.2 Alpha coefficients The most common methods to assess internal consistency are the KR20 (for dichotomous items) and \\(\\alpha\\) (for Likert scaling); alpha has an alias, \\(\\lambda _{3}\\) (i.e., the Guttman lambda 3). Alpha and the Guttman 3 (used for scales with Likert-type scaling) may be thought of as: a function of the number of items and the average correlation between the items the correlation of a test with a non-existent test just like it average of all possible split-half coefficients for the groups tested Although the psych package has an incredible and thorough alpha() function, Revelle is not a fan of alpha. In fact, his alpha function reports a 95% CI around alpha as well as bootstrapped alpha results. Let’s grab alpha coefficients for our total and subscales. psych::alpha(LGBTQT1) Reliability analysis Call: psych::alpha(x = LGBTQT1) raw_alpha std.alpha G6(smc) average_r S/N ase mean sd median_r 0.7 0.7 0.68 0.28 2.4 0.018 4 0.63 0.25 95% confidence boundaries lower alpha upper Feldt 0.66 0.7 0.74 Duhachek 0.66 0.7 0.74 Reliability if an item is dropped: raw_alpha std.alpha G6(smc) average_r S/N alpha se var.r med.r cold 0.64 0.64 0.61 0.27 1.8 0.022 0.0066 0.22 unresponsive 0.66 0.66 0.63 0.28 2.0 0.021 0.0073 0.25 unsupportive 0.67 0.67 0.63 0.29 2.0 0.021 0.0058 0.25 negative 0.66 0.66 0.63 0.28 2.0 0.021 0.0084 0.25 heterosexism 0.66 0.66 0.63 0.28 2.0 0.021 0.0087 0.25 harassed 0.67 0.67 0.64 0.29 2.0 0.021 0.0078 0.25 Item statistics n raw.r std.r r.cor r.drop mean sd cold 646 0.68 0.68 0.59 0.49 4.1 1.03 unresponsive 646 0.63 0.63 0.51 0.43 4.3 0.99 unsupportive 646 0.62 0.62 0.51 0.42 3.7 0.98 negative 646 0.64 0.63 0.51 0.42 4.0 1.04 heterosexism 646 0.61 0.63 0.51 0.43 4.0 0.90 harassed 646 0.63 0.61 0.49 0.41 3.9 1.07 Non missing response frequency for each item 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 miss cold 0.00 0.04 0.22 0.40 0.23 0.09 0.00 0 unresponsive 0.00 0.03 0.17 0.37 0.33 0.09 0.01 0 unsupportive 0.01 0.07 0.35 0.37 0.17 0.02 0.01 0 negative 0.01 0.07 0.23 0.39 0.24 0.05 0.00 0 heterosexism 0.00 0.03 0.24 0.43 0.26 0.03 0.00 0 harassed 0.01 0.07 0.27 0.37 0.22 0.05 0.01 0 The second screen of output shows the information we are interested in: raw_alpha, .70 is based on the covariances std.apha, .70 is based on correlations average_r, .28 is the average inter-item correlation (i.e., all possible pairwise combinations of items) psych::alpha(ResponseT1) Reliability analysis Call: psych::alpha(x = ResponseT1) raw_alpha std.alpha G6(smc) average_r S/N ase mean sd median_r 0.66 0.66 0.57 0.39 1.9 0.023 4 0.77 0.4 95% confidence boundaries lower alpha upper Feldt 0.61 0.66 0.70 Duhachek 0.62 0.66 0.71 Reliability if an item is dropped: raw_alpha std.alpha G6(smc) average_r S/N alpha se var.r med.r cold 0.52 0.52 0.35 0.35 1.1 0.038 NA 0.35 unresponsive 0.60 0.60 0.42 0.42 1.5 0.032 NA 0.42 unsupportive 0.58 0.58 0.40 0.40 1.4 0.033 NA 0.40 Item statistics n raw.r std.r r.cor r.drop mean sd cold 646 0.80 0.79 0.62 0.50 4.1 1.03 unresponsive 646 0.76 0.76 0.55 0.45 4.3 0.99 unsupportive 646 0.76 0.77 0.57 0.46 3.7 0.98 Non missing response frequency for each item 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 miss cold 0.00 0.04 0.22 0.40 0.23 0.09 0.00 0 unresponsive 0.00 0.03 0.17 0.37 0.33 0.09 0.01 0 unsupportive 0.01 0.07 0.35 0.37 0.17 0.02 0.01 0 In the case of the College Response subscale: raw_alpha, .66 is based on the covariances std.apha, .66 is based on correlations average_r, .39 is the average interitem correlation psych::alpha(StigmaT1) Reliability analysis Call: psych::alpha(x = StigmaT1) raw_alpha std.alpha G6(smc) average_r S/N ase mean sd median_r 0.62 0.63 0.53 0.36 1.7 0.025 4 0.76 0.36 95% confidence boundaries lower alpha upper Feldt 0.57 0.62 0.67 Duhachek 0.57 0.62 0.67 Reliability if an item is dropped: raw_alpha std.alpha G6(smc) average_r S/N alpha se var.r med.r negative 0.52 0.52 0.35 0.35 1.1 0.038 NA 0.35 heterosexism 0.53 0.53 0.36 0.36 1.1 0.037 NA 0.36 harassed 0.53 0.54 0.37 0.37 1.2 0.036 NA 0.37 Item statistics n raw.r std.r r.cor r.drop mean sd negative 646 0.77 0.76 0.56 0.44 4.0 1.0 heterosexism 646 0.73 0.76 0.55 0.44 4.0 0.9 harassed 646 0.77 0.75 0.54 0.43 3.9 1.1 Non missing response frequency for each item 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 miss negative 0.01 0.07 0.23 0.39 0.24 0.05 0.00 0 heterosexism 0.00 0.03 0.24 0.43 0.26 0.03 0.00 0 harassed 0.01 0.07 0.27 0.37 0.22 0.05 0.01 0 In the case of the Stigma subscale: raw_alpha, .62 is based on the covariances std.apha, .63 is based on correlations average_r, .36 is the average interitem correlation The documentation for this package is incredible. Scrolling down through the description of the alpha() function provides a description of these different statistics. Especially useful are item-level statistics: r.drop is the corrected item-total correlation (in the next lesson) for this item against the remaining items in the scale mean and sd are the mean and standard deviation of each item across all individuals. The popularity of alpha emerged when tools available for calculation were less sophisticated; since then we have learned that alpha can be misleading: alpha inflates, somewhat artificially, even when inter-item correlations are low. a 14-item scale will have an alpha of at least .70, even if it has two orthogonal (i.e., unrelated) scales (Cortina, 1993), alpha assumes a unidimensional factor structure, the same alpha can be obtained for dramatically different underlying factor structures (see graphs in Revelle’s Chapter 7) The proper use of alpha requires the following: tau equivalence, that is, equal covariances with the latent score represented by the test, and unidimensionality, equal factor loadings on the single factor of the test When either of these is violated, alpha underestimates reliability and overestimates the fraction of test variance that is associated with the general variance in the test. Alpha and the split half are internal consistency estimates. Moving to model-based techniques allows us to take into consideration the factor structure of the scale. In the original article (Szymanski &amp; Bissonette, 2020), results were as follows: 5.4.1.3 Omega Assessing reliability with omega (\\(\\omega\\)) statistics falls into a larger realm of composite reliability where reliability is assessed from a ratio of the variability explained by the items compared with the total variance of the entire scale (McNeish, 2018). Members of the omega family of reliability estimates come from factor exploratory (i.e., EFA) and confirmatory (i.e., CFA; structural equation modeling [SEM]) factor analytic approaches. This lesson precedes the lessons on CFA and SEM. Therefore, my explanations and demonstrations will be somewhat brief. I intend to revisit omega output in the CFA and SEM lessons and encourage you to review this section now, then return to this section again after learning more about CFA and SEM. In the context of psychometrics it may be useful (albeit an oversimplification) to think of factors as scales/subscales where g refers to the amount of variance in the general factor (or total scale score) and subscales to be items that have something in common that is separate from what is g. Model-based estimates examine the correlations or covariances of the items and decompose the test variance into that which is: common to all items (g, a general factor), specific to some items (f, orthogonal group factors), and unique to each item (confounding s specific, and e error variance) \\(\\omega\\) is something of a shapeshifter. In the psych package: \\(\\omega_{t}\\) represents the total reliability of the test (\\(\\omega_{t}\\)) In the psych package, this is calculated from a bifactor model where there is one general g factor (i.e., each item loads on the single general factor), one or more group factors (f), and item-specific factors. \\(\\omega_{h}\\) extracts a higher-order factor from the correlation matrix of lower level factors, then applies the Schmid and Leiman (1957) transformation to find the general loadings on the original items. Stated another way, it is a measure of the general factor saturation (g; the amount of variance attributable to one common factor). The subscript “h” acknowledges the hierarchical nature of the approach. the \\(\\omega_{h}\\) approach is exploratory and defined if there are three or more group factors (with only two group factors, the default is to assume they are equally important, hence the factor loadings of those subscales will be equal) Najera Catalan (Najera Catalan, 2019) suggests that \\(\\omega_{h}\\) is the best measure of reliability when dealing with multiple dimensions. \\(\\omega_{g}\\) is an estimate that uses a bifactor solution via the SEM package lavaan and tends to be a larger (because it forces all the cross loadings of lower level factors to be 0) the \\(\\omega_{g}\\) is confirmatory, requiring the specification of which variables load on each group factor Two commands in psych get us the results: omega() reports only the EFA solution omegaSem() reports both EFA and CFA solutions We will use the omegaSem() function Note that in our specification, we indicate there are two factors. We do not tell it what items belong to what factors (think, subscales). One test will be to see if the items align with their respective factors. psych::omegaSem(LGBTQT1, nfactors = 2) Loading required namespace: GPArotation Three factors are required for identification -- general factor loadings set to be equal.

How do we make sense of it? First, our items aligned perfectly with their respective factors (subscales). That is, it would be problematic if the items switched factors. Second, we can interpret our results. Like alpha, the omegas range from 0 to 1, where values closer to 1 represent good reliability (Najera Catalan, 2019). For unidimensional measures, \\(\\omega_{t}\\) values above 0.80 indicate satisfactory reliability. For multidimensional measures with well-defined dimensions, we strive for \\(\\omega_{h}\\) values above 0.65 (and \\(\\omega_{t}\\) &gt; 0.8). These recommendations are based on a Monte Carlo study that examined a host of reliability indicators and how their values corresponded with accurate predictions of poverty status. With this in mind, let’s examine the output related to our simulated research vignette. Let’s start with the output in the lower portion where the values are “from a confirmatory model using sem.” Omega is a reliability estimate for factor analysis that represents the proportion of variance in the LGBTQ scale attributable to common variance rather than error. The omega for the total reliability of the test (\\(\\omega_{t}\\); which included the general factors and the subscale factors) was .74, meaning that 74% of the variance in the total scale is due to the factors and 26% (100% - 74%) is attributable to error. Omega hierarchical (\\(\\omega_{h}\\)) estimates are the proportion of variance in the LGBTQ score attributable to the general factor, which in effect treats the subscales as error. \\(\\omega_{h}\\) for the the LGBTQ total scale was .54. A quick calculation with \\(\\omega_{h}\\) (.54) and \\(\\omega_{t}\\) (.74; .54/.74 = .72) lets us know that that 73% of the reliable variance in the LGBTQ total scale is attributable to the general factor. .54/.74 [1] 0.7297297 Amongst the output is the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient (.70). Szymanski and Bissonette (2020) did not report omega results; this may be because there were only two subfactors and/or they did not feel like a bifactor analysis would be appropriate. You might notice the lavaan warning indicating that three factors are needed in order to identify the CFA model. There is a longer explanation about factor identification. Stay tuned for CFA models. 5.4.1.4 Some summary statements about reliability from single administrations With the exception of the worst split-half reliability and \\(\\omega_{g}\\) or \\(\\omega_{h}\\), all of the reliability estimates are functions of test length and will tend asymptotically towards 1 as the number of items increases the omega output provides a great deal more information about reliability than a simple alpha Figure 7.5 in Revelle’s chapter shows four different structural representations of measures that have equal alphas (all .72) \\(\\omega_{(h)}\\), \\(\\beta\\), and the worst split-half reliability are estimates of the amount of general factor variance in the test scores in the case of low general factor saturation, the EFA based \\(\\omega_{(h)}\\) is positively biased, so the CFA-based estimate, \\(\\omega_{(g)}\\), should be used \\(\\omega_{(t)}\\) is the model-based estimate of the greatest lower bound of the total reliability of the test; so is the best split-half reliability Revelle and Condon’s (2019b) recommendations to researchers: report at least two coefficients (e.g., \\(\\omega_{(h)}\\) and \\(\\omega_{(t)}\\)) and discuss why each is appropriate for the inference that is being made, report more than “just alpha” unless you can demonstrate that the measure is tau equivalent and unidimensional 5.4.2 Reliability Options for Two or more Administrations 5.4.2.1 Test-retest of total scores The purpose of test-retest reliability is to understand the stability of the measure over time. With two time points, T1 and T2, the test-retest correlation is an unknown mixture of trait, state, and specific variance, and is a function of the length of time between two measures. With two time points we cannot distinguish between trait and state effects, that said we would expect a high degree of stability if the retest is (relatively) immediate With three time points we can leverage some SEM tools to distinguish between trait and state components A large test-retest correlation over a long period of time indicates temporal stability. Temporal stability is: expected if we are assessing something trait like (e.g., cognitive ability, personality trait) not expected if we are assessing something state like (e.g., emotional state, mood) not expected if there was an intervention (or condition) and the T1 and T2 administrations are part of a pre- and post-test design. There are some methodological concerns about test-retest reliability. For example, owing to memory and learning effects, the average response time to a second administration of identical items takes about 80% the time compared to the first administration. Szymanski and Bissonette (2020) did not assess retest reliability. We can, though, imagine how this might work. Let’s imagine that both waves were taken in the same academic term, approximately two weeks apart. With both sets of data we need to create scores for the total scale score and the two subscales. We would also need to join the two datasets into a single dataframe. To demonstrate the retest reliability, I simulated a new dataset with total and subscale scores for our variables for Time 1 and Time 2. This next script is simply that simulation (i.e., you can skip over it). If this were your data, you would have item-level data and need to calculate total and subscale scores (as we did above).

As expected in this simulation, the strongest correlations are within each scale at their respective time, that is: the T1 variables correlate with each other; the T2 variables correlate with each other. the next strongest correlations are with the same scale/subscale configuration across time, for example TotalT1 with TotalT2 (r = .44, p &lt; 0.01) ResponseT1 with ResponseT2 (r = .46, p &lt; 0.01) StigmaT1 with StigmaT2 (r = .47, p &lt; 0.01) the lowest correlations are different scales at T1 and T2 ResponseT1 with StigmaT2 (r = .29) The range of retest correlations (e.g., .44 to .47 with p &lt; 0.01) are sufficient to be confident in test-retest reliability. 5.4.2.2 Test retest recap Here are some summary notions for retest reliability: increases in the interval will lower the reliability coefficient, an experimental intervention that is designed to impact the retest assessment will lower the reliability coefficient, state measures will have lower retest coefficients than trait measures, and, the three phenomena above all interact with each other Revelle and Condon’s (2019b, 2019a) materials elaborate on this further. Their Table 1 is especially helpful. In addition to the myriad of vignettes used to illustrate issues with state, trait, items, whole scale, and so forth, there are demonstrations for duplicated items, assessing for consistency, and parallel/alternate forms. If you are asking, “Hey, is parallel/alternate forms really a variant of test retest?” Great question! In fact, split-half could be seen as test-retest! Once you get in the weeds, the distinctions become less clear. 5.4.3 Interrater Reliability 5.4.3.1 Cohen’s kappa Cohen’s kappa coefficient is used to calculate proportions of agreement corrected for chance. This type of analysis occurs in research designs where there is some kind of (usually) categorical designation of a response. I don’t have an outside research vignette for this. In the past, I was involved in research where members of the research team coded counselor utterances according to Hill’s helping skills system designed by Clara Hill (Hill, 2020). In the helping skills system, 15 different helping skills are divided into three larger groups that generally reflect the counseling trajectory: exploration, insight, action. One of our analyses coded counselor utterances into these three categories. Let’s look at a fabricated (not based on any real data) simulation where four raters each evaluated 12 counselor utterances (that represent the arch of a nonsensically speedy counseling session). Rater1 &lt;- c(&quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;insight&quot;, &quot;insight&quot;, &quot;action&quot;, &quot;action&quot;, &quot;action&quot;, &quot;action&quot;) Rater2 &lt;- c(&quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;insight&quot;, &quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;insight&quot;, &quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;action&quot;, &quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;action&quot;) Rater3 &lt;- c(&quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;insight&quot;, &quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;insight&quot;, &quot;insight&quot;, &quot;insight&quot;, &quot;action&quot;, &quot;action&quot;) Rater4 &lt;- c(&quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;action&quot;, &quot;action&quot;, &quot;action&quot;) ratings &lt;- data.frame(Rater1, Rater2, Rater3, Rater4) Historically, kappa could only be calculated for 2 raters at a time. Presently, though, it appears there can be any number of raters and the average agreement is reported. Let’s take a look at the data, then run the analysis, and interpret the results. psych::cohen.kappa(ratings) Cohen Kappa (below the diagonal) and Weighted Kappa (above the diagonal) For confidence intervals and detail print with all=TRUE Rater1 Rater2 Rater3 Rater4 Rater1 1.00 0.40 0.21 0.62 Rater2 0.14 1.00 0.00 0.57 Rater3 0.48 0.00 1.00 0.30 Rater4 0.54 0.45 0.43 1.00 Average Cohen kappa for all raters 0.34 Average weighted kappa for all raters 0.35 Kappa can range from -1.00 to 1.00. K = .00 indicates that the observed agreement is exactly equal to the agreement that could be observed by chance. Negative kappa indicates that observed kappa is less than the expected chance agreement. K = 1.00 equals perfect agreement between judges. There are commonly understood concerns about using kappa: Research teams typically set an expected standard (e.g., .85) and train raters until kappa is achieved. In lengthy projects, rating agreement is rechecked periodically; if necessary there is retraining. Obtaining an acceptable kappa becomes difficult as the number of categories increases. An example is Hill’s Helping Skills System when all 15 categories; we chose to use the three categories (into which the 15 categories are subsumed). It is also difficult to obtain an adequate kappa when infrequent categories (e.g., “insight”) exist. Our kappa of .35 indicates that this rating team has a 35% chance of agreement, corrected for by chance. This is substantially below the standard. Let’s imagine that the team spends time with their dictionaries, examines common errors, and makes some decision rules. Here’s the resimulation of “improved” agreement. Rater1b &lt;- c(&quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;insight&quot;, &quot;insight&quot;, &quot;insight&quot;, &quot;action&quot;, &quot;action&quot;, &quot;action&quot;) Rater2b &lt;- c(&quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;insight&quot;, &quot;insight&quot;, &quot;insight&quot;, &quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;action&quot;, &quot;action&quot;, &quot;action&quot;) Rater3b &lt;- c(&quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;insight&quot;, &quot;insight&quot;, &quot;insight&quot;, &quot;action&quot;, &quot;action&quot;) Rater4b &lt;- c(&quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;exploration&quot;, &quot;insight&quot;, &quot;action&quot;, &quot;action&quot;, &quot;action&quot;) after_training &lt;- data.frame(Rater1b, Rater2b, Rater3b, Rater4b) Now run it again. psych::cohen.kappa(after_training) Warning in cohen.kappa1(x1, w = w, n.obs = n.obs, alpha = alpha, levels = levels): upper or lower confidence interval exceed abs(1) and set to +/- 1.

This is the same ICC we use in multilevel modeling! The ICC is used when we have numerical ratings. In our fabricated vignette below, five raters are evaluating the campus climate for LGBTQIA+ individuals for 10 units/departments on a college campus. Using the ICC can help us determine the degree of leniency and variability within judges. Below is a simulation of the data (you can ignore this)… Rater1 &lt;- c(1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 3, 1, 3, 3, 5) Rater2 &lt;- c(1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5) Rater3 &lt;- c(3, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 4, 4, 5) Rater4 &lt;- c(3, 5, 4, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 5, 5) Rater5 &lt;- c(2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5) ICC_df &lt;- data.frame(Rater1, Rater2, Rater3, Rater4, Rater5) #If the code below will not run remove the hashtags from the two lines of code below to install the Matrix package and then the lme4 package from its source #tools::package_dependencies(&quot;Matrix&quot;, which = &quot;LinkingTo&quot;, reverse = TRUE)[[1L]] #install.packages(&quot;lme4&quot;, type = &quot;source&quot;) We can use the psych::ICC function to obtain the ICC values. # psych::ICC(ICC_df [1:10,1:5], lmer = TRUE) #find the ICCs for the # 10 campus units and 5 judges psych::ICC(ICC_df, missing = TRUE, alpha = 0.05, lmer = TRUE, check.keys = FALSE) Call: psych::ICC(x = ICC_df, missing = TRUE, alpha = 0.05, lmer = TRUE, check.keys = FALSE) Intraclass correlation coefficients type ICC F df1 df2 p lower bound upper bound Single_raters_absolute ICC1 0.34 3.5 9 40 0.00259 0.082 0.70 Single_random_raters ICC2 0.37 5.4 9 36 0.00011 0.118 0.71 Single_fixed_raters ICC3 0.47 5.4 9 36 0.00011 0.188 0.78 Average_raters_absolute ICC1k 0.72 3.5 9 40 0.00259 0.308 0.92 Average_random_raters ICC2k 0.74 5.4 9 36 0.00011 0.400 0.92 Average_fixed_raters ICC3k 0.81 5.4 9 36 0.00011 0.537 0.95 Number of subjects = 10 Number of Judges = 5 See the help file for a discussion of the other 4 McGraw and Wong estimates, In the output, reliability for a single judge \\(ICC_1\\) is the ratio of person variance to total variance. Reliability for multiple judges \\(ICC_1k\\) adjusts the residual variance by the number of judges. The ICC function reports six reliability coefficients: 3 for the case of single judges and 3 for the case of multiple judges. It also reports the results in terms of a traditional ANOVA as well as a mixed effects linear model. Additionally, confidence intervals are reported. Like most correlation coefficients, the ICC ranges from 0 to 1. An ICC close to 1 indicates high similarity between values from the same group. An ICC close to zero means that values from the same group are not similar. 5.5 What do we do with these coefficients? 5.5.1 Corrections for attenuation Circa 1904, Spearman created the reliability coeffient out of a need to adjust observed correlations between related constructs for the error of measurement in each construct. This is only appropriate if the measure is seen as the expected value of a single underlying construct. However, “under the hood,” SEM programs model the pattern of observed correlations in terms of a measurement (reliability) model as well as a structural (validity) model. 5.5.2 Predicting true scores (and their CIs) True scores remain unknown and so the reliability coefficient is used in a couple of ways to estimate the true score (and the confidence interval [CI] around that true score). Take a quick look at the formula for predicting a true score and observe that the reliability coefficient is used within. It generally serves to nudge the observed score a bit closer to the mean: \\(T&#39;=(1-r_{xx})\\bar{X}+r_{xx}X\\) The CI around that true score includes some estimate of standard error: \\(CI_{95}=T&#39;+/-z_{cv}(s_{e})\\). Two estimates are commonly used. One is the standard error of estimate \\(s_{e}=s_{x}\\sqrt{r_{xx}(1-r_{xx})}\\) (i.e., the standard deviation of predicted true scores for a given observed score). Another is the standard error of measurement (\\(s_{m}=s_{x}\\sqrt{(1-r_{xx})}\\) (i.e., an estimate of the amount of variation to be expected in test scores; aka, the standard deviation of the errors of measurement). I can hear you asking What is the difference between \\(s_{e}\\) and \\(s_{m}\\)? Because \\(r_{xx}\\) is almost always a fraction, \\(s_{e}\\) is smaller than \\(s_{m}\\). When the reliability is high, the two standard errors are fairly similar to each other. Using \\(s_{m}\\) will result in wider confidence intervals. 5.5.3 How do I keep it all straight? Table 1 in Revelle and Condon’s (Revelle &amp; Condon, 2019b) article helps us connect the the type of reliability we are seeking with the statistic(s) and the R function within the psych package. 5.6 Practice Problems In each of these lessons I provide suggestions for practice that allow you to select one or more problems that are graded in difficulty. The practice problems are the start of a larger project that spans multiple lessons. Therefore,if possible, please use a dataset that has item-level data for which there is a theorized total scale score as well as two or more subscales. With each of these options I encourage you to: Format (i.e., rescore if necessary) a dataset so that it is possible to calculates estimates of internal consistency Calculate and report the alpha coefficient for a total scale scores and subscales (if the scale has them) Calculate and report \\(\\omega_{t}\\) and \\(\\omega_{h}\\). With these two determine what proportion of the variance is due to all the factors, error, and g. Calculate total and subscale scores. Describe other reliability estimates that would be appropriate for the measure you are evaluating. 5.6.1 Problem #1: Play around with this simulation. If evaluating internal consistency is new to you, copy the script for the simulation and then change (at least) one thing in the simulation to see how it impacts the results. Perhaps you just change the number in “set.seed(210827)” from 210827 to something else. Your results should parallel those obtained in the lecture, making it easier for you to check your work as you go. 5.6.2 Problem #2: Use the data from the live ReCentering Psych Stats survey. The script below pulls live data directly from the ReCentering Psych Stats survey on Qualtrics. As described in the Scrubbing and Scoring chapters of the ReCentering Psych Stats Multivariate Modeling volume, the Perceptions o the LGBTQ College Campus Climate Scale (Szymanski &amp; Bissonette, 2020) was included (LGBTQ) and further adapted to assess perceptions of campus climate for Black students (BLst), non-Black students of color (nBSoC), international students (INTst), and students disabilities (wDIS).

As a brief review, this data is part of an IRB-approved study, with consent to use in teaching demonstrations and to be made available to the general public via the open science framework. Hence, it is appropriate to use in this context. You will notice there are student- and teacher- IDs. These numbers are not actual student and teacher IDs, rather they were further re-identified so that they could not be connected to actual people. Because this is an actual dataset, if you wish to work the problem along with me, you will need to download the ReC.rds data file from the Worked_Examples folder in the ReC_Psychometrics project on the GitHub. The course evaluation items can be divided into three subscales: Valued by the student includes the items: ValObjectives, IncrUnderstanding, IncrInterest Traditional pedagogy includes the items: ClearResponsibilities, EffectiveAnswers, Feedback, ClearOrganization, ClearPresentation Socially responsive pedagogy includes the items: InclusvClassrm, EquitableEval, MultPerspectives, DEIintegration In this homework focused on reliability we will report alpha coefficients for total scale score and subscale scores. We’ll also calculate omega total and omega hierarchical and determine what proportion of variance is due to all the factors, error, and g. Finally, we’ll calculate total and subscale scores. 5.7.1 Check and, if needed, format the data big &lt;- readRDS(&quot;ReC.rds&quot;) Let’s check the structure… str(big) Classes &#39;data.table&#39;

We look at item difficulty and item discrimination. We also look at item coverage as it relates to the learning objectives for an educational endeavor. 6.1 Navigating this Lesson There is about one hour of lecture. If you work through the materials with me it would be plan for an additional 30 minutes. While the majority of R objects and data you will need are created within the R script that sources the chapter, occasionally there are some that cannot be created from within the R framework. Additionally, sometimes links fail. All original materials are provided at the Github site that hosts the book. More detailed guidelines for ways to access all these materials are provided in the OER’s introduction 6.1.1 Learning Objectives Focusing on this week’s materials, make sure you can: Provide a rationale for why having a test bank might be a good idea. Describe the effects of skewness on the interpretation of exam results. Evaluate the the quality of a multiple choice item on the basis of item difficulty, correlation, and discrimination. Discuss the challenges of identifying an ideal difficulty level for test items. Further elaborate how guessing, speeded tests, interitem correlations, and the purposes of the test influence the ideal difficulty. 6.1.2 Planning for Practice Practice suggestions for this lesson encourage you to think about the exams in your life: those you might be taking; those you might be writing or proctoring. 6.1.3 Readings &amp; Resources Classic psychometric texts tend to not cover item analysis for achievement tests and/or they skip over these fundamentals and move straight to item response theory/Rasch modeling (IRT). After scouring the internet, I landed on these two resources as concise, accessible, summaries. Understanding item analysis. Office of Educational Assessment, University of Washington. Retrieved September 20, 2019. Retrieved from https://www.washington.edu/assessment/scanning-scoring/scoring/reports/item-analysis/ It is common for excellent instructions/descriptions to accompany the scoring software used by institutions. UW appears to use ScorePak and this resource provides both conceptual and interpretive information. Revelle, W. (2017). An overview of the psych package. Retrieved from http://personality-project.org/r/overview.pdf Pages 85-85 provide a vignette for conducting item analysis on multiple choice items. 6.1.4 Packages The packages used in this lesson are embedded in this code.

Especially in the early years of my teaching, I gave high(er) stakes mid-term and final exams. There were usually 40 (or so) multiple choice or true/false items, 2-3 applied problems or short essays, and 1 longer essay. Today’s vignette are an array of exam items from a statistics exam that demonstrate the desirable and undesirable elements we want in objective items. 6.3 Item Analysis in the Educational/Achievement Context Multiple choice, true/false, and other objectively formatted/scored items are part-n-parcel to educational/achievement assessment. But how do we know if the items are performing the way they should? This lecture focuses on item analysis in the context of multiple choice and true/false items. Using these practices can help you identify what selection of items you’d like for your exams. These can be critical tools in helping you improve your ability to assess student performance. In-so-doing, we walk through a bit of “what we used to do,” to current common practices, to a glimpse of our future. We owe much of this to rapid advances in technology. Test banks are instructor-created resources for developing/storing/protecting items for use in future exams. We create test banks when we carefully distribute/collect/protect items “that work” (from statistical perspective). Why would we want to do this? Once a test is “out” it’s out. Instructors can presume that resourceful students are using it to study; yet all students won’t have equal access to it. Developing “good” items takes a good deal of time; does the instructor want to redo this each term? Should we be piloting all new items on students each term and then having the debates about whether the item should be rescored? Better is to introduce a proportion of new items each year and evaluate them for inclusion in the test bank; EPPP, SAT, GRE do this. A challenge is providing students appropriate study tools – old exams are favorites of students (but maybe there are other ways – worksheets, Jeopardy). The conceptual portions of this lecture, particularly the interpretation of the difficulty and discrimination statistics are based in Anastasi’s work (Anastasi &amp; Urbina, 1997) 6.3.1 And now a quiz! Please take it. Let’s start with some items from an early version of the exam I gave when I taught CPY7020/Statistical Methods. Item 5 A grouping variable such as men or women that uses dummy coding of 1 and 0 to categorize the groups is an example of _____ scaling. Nominal Ordinal Interval Ratio Item 11 The term “grade inflation” has frequently been applied to describe the distribution of grades in graduate school. Which of the following best describes this distribution. negatively skewed uniform/rectangular positively skewed and leptokurtic uniform and platykurtic Item 19 All distributions of Z-scores will have the identical Mean Variance Standard deviation All of the above Item 21 The most appropriate score for comparing scores across two or more distributions (e.g., exam scores in math and art classes) is the: mean percentile rank raw score z-score Item 37 Of the following, what statement best describes \\(r^2\\) = .49 strong positive correlation strong positive or negative correlation weak positive or negative correlation weak negative correlation Item 38 When there are no ties among ranks, what is the relationship between the Spearman rho (\\(\\rho\\)) and the Pearson (\\(r\\))? \\(\\rho\\) = \\(r\\) \\(\\rho\\) &gt; \\(r\\) \\(\\rho\\) &lt; \\(r\\) no relationship 6.4 Item Difficulty 6.4.1 Percent passing Item difficulty index is the proportion of test takers who answer an item correctly. It is calculated by dividing the number of people who passed the item (e.g., 55) by the total number of people (e.g., 100). If 55% pass an item, we write \\(p\\) = .55 The easier the item, the larger the percentage will be. What is an ideal pass rate (and this “ideal” is the statistical ideal mostly for norm-referenced tests like the ACT, SAT, GRE)? The closer the difficulty of an item approaches 1.00 or 0, the less differential information about test takers it contributes. If, out of 100 people, 50 pass an item and 50 fail (\\(p\\) = .50)…we have 50 X 50 or 2,500 paired comparisons or differential bits of information. How much information would we have for an item passed by: 70% of the people (70 * 30 = ???) 90% of the people (90 * 10 = ???) For maximum differentiation, one would choose all items at the .50 level (but hold up…) 6.4.2 Several factors prevent .50 from being the ideal difficulty level Speeded tests complicate the interpretation of item difficulty because items are usually of equivalent difficulty and there are so many that no one could complete them all. Thus later items should be considered to be more difficult – but item difficulty is probably not the best assessment of item/scale quality. Guessing the correct answer in true/false and multiple choice contexts interferes with the goal of \\(p\\) - .50. In a 1952 issue of Psychometrika, Lord provided this guide for optimal \\(p\\) values based on the number of choices in the objective context: Optimal p values Number of Choices Optimal Mean Difficulty Level 2 (T/F) 0.85 3 0.77 4 0.74 5 0.69 Constructed response essay 0.5 The purpose of the testing changes the ideal difficulty level. If the test is norm-referenced (ACT, SAT, GRE), .50 is very useful. If the test is mastery oriented, \\(p\\) values may be be as high as 0.90 since student performance is a function of repeated attempts with feedback. Item intercorrelations impacts interpretation of item difficulty. The more homogeneous the test, the higher these intercorrelations will be. If all items were perfectly intercorrelated and all were of the .50 difficulty level: the same 50 persons out of 100 would pass each item, that is, half of the test takers would obtain perfect scores, the other half zero scores It is best to select items with a moderate spread of difficulty but whose AVERAGE difficulty level is .50 The percentage of persons passing an item expresses the item difficulty in terms of which statistical scale of measurement? Is it nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio? Because of this issue, we can correctly indicate the rank order or relative difficulty of the items However, we cannot infer that the difference in difficulty between Items 1 and 2 is equal to the difference between Items 2 and 3. We can make an equal-interval inference with the table of normal curve frequencies (i.e., translating the proportion to z-scores). Z-scores would be used as the units if an equal interval inference was required in the analysis. For example, p = .84 is equal to -1 SD p = .16 is equal to +1 SD Seem a little upside down? Recall that we are calculating the percent passing and starting the count “from the top.” So a relatively easy item where 84% passed, would have an standard deviation of -1. Image of graphs where p = .84 and p = .16 6.5 Item Discrimination The degree to which an item differentiates correctly among test takers in the behavior that the test is designed to measure. the criterion can be internal or external to the test itself under some conditions, the two approaches lead to opposite results because (a) items chosen to maximize the validity of the test tend to be the ones rejected on the basis of internal consistency, and (b) rejecting items with low correlations with the total score tends to homogenize the test (we are more likely to keep items with the highest average intercorrelations) internal criteria maximizes internal consistency or homogeneity of the test. Example: achievement test, where criteria is total score itself external criteria maximize the validity of an external criterion. Example: a different assessment of the same ability being assessed 6.5.1 Index of Discrimination Compare the proportion of cases that pass an item in contrasting criterion groups upper (U) and lower (L) criterion groups are selected from the extremes of the distribution traditionally these groups are created from the 27% from each of those sides of the distribution This index of discrimination (D) can be expressed as a difference of raw frequencies (U - L), or (more conventionally) as the difference of percentages of those who scored it correctly in the upper 27% and lower 27% groups when all members of the U group and none of the members of the L group pass, D = 100 when all members of the L group and none of the members of the U group pass, D = 0 optimum point at which these two conditions reach balance is with the upper and lower 27% Optimal Discrimination Difficulty Discrimination 0.40 and larger Excellent 0.30 - 0.39 Good 0.11 - 0.29 Fair 0.00 -0.10 Poor Negative values Mis-keyed or other major flaw 6.5.2 Application of Item Difficulty and Discrimination Earlier I asked you to “take the quiz.” To keep it engaging, I encourage you to look at your own answers and compare them to “what happened” from in this actual exam administration. I will demonstrate how to evaluate my exam items with these indices of difficulty and discrimination. I have intentionally selected items with a variety of desirable (and undesirable) characteristics. Image of scores and responses of 6 items from 12 students. Item 5 A grouping variable such as men or women that uses dummy coding of 1 and 0 to categorize the groups is an example of _____ scaling. Nominal Ordinal Interval Ratio If we wanted to hand-calculate the index of discrimination for Item #5, we find that 3 people (100%) in the upper group selected the correct answer and 3 people (100%) in the lower group selected the correct answer: 3 - 3 = 0. If you prefer percentages: 100% - 100% = 0%. This means there is no discrimination in performance of the upper and lower performing groupings. Older scoring systems (e.g., Scantron) used to provide this information. Scantron image of item analysis for exam item #5 Considering what we have learned already, Item #5 is: too easy does not discriminate between upper and lower performance Yes, there is more data on here, but we will save it for the next level of review…just a few moments. Item 11 The term “grade inflation” has frequently been applied to describe the distribution of grades in graduate school. Which of the following best describes this distribution. negatively skewed uniform/rectangular positively skewed and leptokurtic uniform and platykurtic For Item #11, 2 people (~66%) from the upper group selected the correct answer, 1 person (~33%) from the lower group selected the correct answer. Thus, the U-L was +1 (+33%) and the item is working in the proper direction. Scantron image of item analysis for exam item #11 Considering what we have learned already, Item #11 is: difficult (50% overall selected the correct item) does discriminate between upper and lower performance, with more individuals in the upper groups selecting the correct answer than in the lower group Item 19 All distributions of Z-scores will have the identical Mean Variance Standard deviation All of the above Hand calculation: Upper = 3 (100%), Lower = 3 (100%). Difference = 0. Scantron image of item analysis for exam item #19 Considering what we have learned already, Item #19 is: somewhat easy (92% overall selected the correct item) using the U - L discrimination index, it does not discriminate between upper and lower performance Item 21 The most appropriate score for comparing scores across two or more distributions (e.g., exam scores in math and art classes) is the: mean percentile rank raw score z-score Hand calculation: Upper = 2 (66%), Lower = 3 (100%). Difference = -33%. This item is upside down. This is different than the Scantron snip below because uppers and lowers were likely calculated on exam total that included subjectively scored items (essays; and I no longer have that data). Scantron image of item analysis for exam item #21 Considering what we have learned already, Item #21 is: somewhat difficult (58% overall selected the correct item) on the basis of the hand-calculations it does not discriminate between uppers and lowers Item 37 Of the following, what statement best describes \\(r^2\\) = .49 strong positive correlation strong positive or negative correlation weak positive or negative correlation weak negative correlation Hand calculation: Upper = 2 (66%), Lower = 0 (0%). Difference = 66%. Scantron image of item analysis for exam item #37 Considering what we have learned already, Item #37 is: very difficult (33% overall selected the correct item) on the basis of the hand-calculations, this completely discriminates the uppers from the lowers) Item 38 When there are no ties among ranks, what is the relationship between the Spearman rho (\\(\\rho\\)) and the Pearson r (\\(r\\))? \\(\\rho\\) = \\(r\\) \\(\\rho\\) &gt; \\(r\\) \\(\\rho\\) &lt; \\(r\\) no relationship Hand calculation: Upper = 1 (33%), Lower = 1 (33%). Difference = 0%. Scantron image of item analysis for exam item #38 Considering what we have learned already, Item #21 is: very difficult (25% overall selected the correct item) on the basis of the hand-calculations, this does not discrimniate the uppers from the lowers 6.6 In the psych Package Using the score.multiple.choice() function in the psych package. Documentation is pp. 85-86 in http://personality-project.org/r/overview.pdf A multiple choice exam presumes that there is one correct response. We start with a dataset that records the students’ responses. It appears that the psych package requires these responses to be numerical (rather than A, B, C, D). # For portability of the lesson, I hand-entered the exam score data. # Variables are items (not students), so the entry is the 41 items # for the 12 students Item1 &lt;- c(1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1) Item2 &lt;- c(4, 4, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4) Item3 &lt;- c(1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1) Item4 &lt;- c(2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2) Item5 &lt;- c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1) Item6 &lt;- c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1) Item7 &lt;- c(3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2) Item8 &lt;- c(1, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 4, 2, 2) Item9 &lt;- c(1, 1, 4, 4, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4) Item10 &lt;- c(3, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3) Item11 &lt;- c(1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 3, 4, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3) Item12 &lt;- c(2, 1, 2, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2) Item13 &lt;- c(2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1) Item14 &lt;- c(2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2) Item15 &lt;- c(2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 2) Item16 &lt;- c(2, 2, 2, 4, 4, 2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 1) Item17 &lt;- c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1) Item18 &lt;- c(3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3) Item19 &lt;- c(4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4) Item20 &lt;- c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1) Item21 &lt;- c(2, 4, 4, 4, 2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 4, 4, 4) Item22 &lt;- c(3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1) Item23 &lt;- c(3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2) Item24 &lt;- c(3, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1) Item25 &lt;- c(2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2) Item26 &lt;- c(4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 4, 4, 1) Item27 &lt;- c(4, 4, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4) Item28 &lt;- c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1) Item29 &lt;- c(1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1) Item30 &lt;- c(2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2) Item31 &lt;- c(1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2) Item32 &lt;- c(1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1) Item33 &lt;- c(3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3) Item34 &lt;- c(3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3) Item35 &lt;- c(3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3) Item36 &lt;- c(2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2) Item37 &lt;- c(2, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 1) Item38 &lt;- c(1, 4, 4, 4, NA, 4, 4, 4, 1, 4, 4, 1) Item39 &lt;- c(3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3) Item40 &lt;- c(3, 3, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3) Item41 &lt;- c(2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 4, 4, 2, 2, 4, 4, 2) exam &lt;- data.frame(Item1, Item2, Item3, Item4, Item5, Item6, Item7, Item8, Item9, Item10, Item11, Item12, Item13, Item14, Item15, Item16, Item17, Item18, Item19, Item20, Item21, Item22, Item23, Item24, Item25, Item26, Item27, Item28, Item29, Item30, Item31, Item32, Item33, Item34, Item35, Item36, Item37, Item38, Item39, Item40, Item41) The optional script below will let you save the simulated data to your computing environment as either a .csv file (think “Excel lite”) or .rds object (preserves any formatting you might do). # write the simulated data as a .csv write.table(exam, # file=&#39;exam.csv&#39;, sep=&#39;,&#39;, col.names=TRUE, row.names=FALSE) bring # back the simulated dat from a .csv file exam &lt;- read.csv # (&#39;exam.csv&#39;, header = TRUE) # to save the df as an .rds (think &#39;R object&#39;) file on your computer;

In this context, alpha should tell us the consistency of getting answers right or wrong. Technically, the alpha is reduced to a KR-20 (Kuder Richardson 20). We interpret it the same. Alpha is directly effected by: interitem correlations among the items – a large number of positive correlations between items increases alpha test length – more items produce higher reliability (all things else equal) test content – the more diverse/broad, the lower the reliability coefficient In the context of the classroom, reliabilities above .70 are probably adequate and above .80 are good. Reliabilities below .60 suggest that items should be investigated and additional measures (tests, homework assignments) should be included in assigning grades. Focus instead on the second screen of output. key indicates which answer was correct. 1, 2, 3, 4 (there would be as many as there are options in the multiple choice exam) provide a distractor analysis by indicating the percentage of time that answer was chosen. For item 1, option 1 was correct, and it was chosen 92% of the time. No individuals chose options 2 or 3. Option 4 was chosen 8% of the time. miss indicates how many times the item was skipped. r is a point-biserial correlation with a dichotomous correct/incorrect correlated with the continuously scaled total scale score. Positively scored items let us know that the item is working in the proper direction; the students who got the item correct, did better on the overall total score and vice versa. one of the best indicators of an items ability to discriminate (hence, item discrimination) among the criterion assessed on the test it is important to investigate those with values close to zero (no relation between item performance with overall test performance) and those with negative values (meaning that those who had the correct answer on the item were those who scored lower on the exam). n tells us how many participants completed the item (this would necessarily be the inverse of “miss”). mean repeats the proportion of individuals who scored correctly; it would be the same as the percentage in the item keyed as the correct one. This is an indication of item dificulty. sd gives an indication of the variability around that mean It is mportant to look at the r and mean columns, together to understand the degree of difficulty and how well each item is discriminating between performance levels. skew can provide an indication of ceiling and floor effects. Image of two graphs illustrating positive and negative skew If a score has a significant negative skew (long tail to the left), then there may be a piling up of items at the upper end of the scale. This would indicate an insufficient ceiling and make it more difficult to discriminate among differences among the higher performers. If a score has a significant positive skew (long tail to the right), then there may be a piling up of items at the low end, indicating an insufficient floor. That is, it lacks the ability to discriminate between poorer performers. How do you tell what is significant? A general rule of thumb says that anything greater or less than the absolute value of 1.0 is significantly skewed. A formal z-test can be conducted this way: \\(z_{skewness}= \\frac{S-0}{SE_{skewness}}\\) In our exam dataset, -2.65 is the most extremely negatively skewed item and its se = 0.08. -2.65/0.08 [1] -33.125 Considering that anything greater than +/- 1.96 is statistically significant, it is safe to say that this item has an insufficient ceiling. What about the items with -0.30 (se = 0.15)? -.30/.15 [1] -2 This is not as extreme (and recall my N = 12, so I should probably look up a critical t value), but there is still some question about whether my exam items can discriminate among high performers. Please note, because these distributions are dichotomous (correct/incorrect) they will never be normally distributed, but, like the difficulty index, they give another glimpse of the ability to discriminate. Before we look at the specific exam items and their output from the scoring function, let me introduce you to the features of the psych package that draw from item response theory (IRT). 6.6.1 A Mini-Introduction to IRT To recap – at the instructional level, the combination of percent passing (mean) and point-biserial correlation (discrimination index) is status quo for evaluating/improving the items. The psych package draws from its IRT capacity to conduct distractor analysis. IRT models individual responses to items by estimating individual ability (theta) and item difficulty (diff) parameters. In these graphs, theta is on the X axis. Theta is the standard unit of the IRT model that represents the level of the domain being measured. Like a z-score, a theta unit of “1” is the SD of the calibrated sample. The pattern of responses to multiple choice ability items can show that some items have poor distractors. This may be done by using the the irt.responses function. A good distractor is one that is negatively related to ability. As we look at each of the exam items, we will look at the psych input from the scoring function as well as use the results objects to create the IRT graphs. Item 5 A grouping variable such as men or women that uses dummy coding of 1 and 0 to categorize the groups is an example of _____ scaling. Nominal Ordinal Interval Ratio Mean = 1.0 (much too easy), r = NA, Distractors: 1.00 0.00 0.00 0.00, skew = -2.65 # irt.responses(scores$scores, exam[5], breaks = 2) psych::irt.responses(results$scores, exam[5], breaks = 2) Number of categories should be increased in order to count frequencies.

Warning in rbind(items, dummy): number of columns of result is not a multiple of vector length (arg 1) With Item #5, 100% responded correctly (the flat, solid line at the top); there is not much to see. Item 11 The term “grade inflation” has frequently been applied to describe the distribution of grades in graduate school. Which of the following best describes this distribution. negatively skewed uniform/rectangular positively skewed and leptokurtic uniform and platykurtic Mean = .50, r = .42, Distractors: 0.50 0.00 0.33 0.17, skew = 0.00 psych::irt.responses(results$scores, exam[11], breaks = 2) Number of categories should be increased in order to count frequencies.

These map onto each of the point-biserial correlations associated with the distractors in the Scantron output. Item 19 All distributions of Z-scores will have the identical Mean Variance Standard deviation All of the above Mean = .92, r = .04, Distractors: 0.08 0.00 0.00 0.92 , skew = -2.65 psych::irt.responses(results$scores, exam[19], breaks = 2) Number of categories should be increased in order to count frequencies.

Warning in rbind(items, dummy): number of columns of result is not a multiple of vector length (arg 1) Item #19 shows rather flat (no relationship) relations with ability for the correct item and the lone distractor. Item 21 The most appropriate score for comparing scores across two or more distributions (e.g., exam scores in math and art classes) is the: mean percentile rank raw score z-score Mean = .58, r = -.19, Distractors: 0.00 0.42 0.00 0.58, skew = -0.30 psych::irt.responses(results$scores, exam[21], breaks = 2) Number of categories should be increased in order to count frequencies.

This makes sense as the point biserial for the overall item was 0-.13.

Regarding overall test characteristics 6.7 Closing Thoughts on Developing Measures in the Education/Achievement Context Item analysis tends to be an assessment of reliability. However, in the context of educational assessment and achievement exams, there are also validity issues. Content validity is concerned with whether or not the scale adequately represents the entirety of the domain to be assessed. In educational and achievement contexts, this is often accomplished with a table of specifications. I introduced this in the Validity lesson. As a refresher, I will include another example – imagining that I am going to write a quiz or short exam based on the learning objectives of this, single, lesson. There are a number of different ways to organize the types of knowledge that is being assessed. Since the American Psychological Association (and others) work in “KSAs” (knowledge, skills, attitudes) in their accreditation standards, I will use those. In creating a table of specifications, we start with the learning objectives. Then we decide what type of items to write and what type of performance level they satisfy. This helps us ensure that all learning objectives are proportionately covered, using a variety of assessment approaches. Otherwise, we might be tempted to include the items that come easily to us or that are from our favorite topics. Personally, I find that when I work on the exam, and am informed by the learning objectives and table of specifications, I find myself tinkering with all three. I am inclined to believe that this results in an ever-increasingly-improved pedagogy. Table of Specifications Learning Objectives Knowledge Skills Attitudes % of test Provide a rationale for why having a test bank might be a good idea. 1 item 30% Describe the effects of skewness on the interpretation of exam results. 2 items 10% Evaluate the the quality of a multiple choice item on the basis of item difficulty, correlation, and discrimination. 5 items 25% Discuss the challenges of identifying an ideal difficulty level for test items. Further elaborate how guessing, speeded tests, interitem correlations, and the purposes of the test influence the ideal difficulty. 2 items 1 item 35% TOTALS 4 items 5 items 2 items 100% There are a variety of free resources that help with this process. Below are some that I find helpful: Bloom’s Taxonomy Verbs, freely available from Fractus Learning. The Bloom’s Taxonomy Verbs Poster for Teachers If you have “writer’s block” for writing objectives, here is a learning outcome generator that may help get you started. From APA’s Education Directorate, Guidance for Writing Behavioral Learning Objectives. The APA Guidance really emphasizes key components of well-written behavioral leaning objectives. These include: observable and measurable, using action verbs that describe measureable behaviors. The APA CE office disallows the use of “understand” as an action verb, statements that clearly describe what the learner will know or be able to do as a result of having participated, focused on the learner and learning (as opposed to what the trainer is doing or leading), appropriate in breadth (not too few or too many) Takeaway message: Together, mapping out exam coverage in a table of specifications PLUS item analysis (difficulty/discrimination) can be powerful tools in educational assessment. 6.8 Practice Problems For this particular lesson, I think some of the most meaningful practice comes from multiple choice and true/false exams that occur in your life. If you are in a class, see if your instructor is willing to share item analysis information that they have received. Learning management systems like Canvas, automatically calculate these. If you are an instructor, calculate and review item analysis data on your own items. Think about how you might improve items between exams and cconsider how the dificulty and discrimination capacity of the item changes.

We use information about alpha coefficients and item-total correlations (within and across subscales) to help assess what we might consider to be within-scale convergent and discriminant validity (although we tend to think of it as an assessment of reliability). 7.1 Navigating this Lesson There is about 45 minutes of lecture. If you work through the materials with me it would be plan for an additional hour. While the majority of R objects and data you will need are created within the R script that sources the chapter, occasionally there are some that cannot be created from within the R framework. Additionally, sometimes links fail. All original materials are provided at the Github site that hosts the book. More detailed guidelines for ways to access all these materials are provided in the OER’s introduction 7.1.1 Learning Objectives Focusing on this week’s materials, make sure you can: Define the corrected item-total correlation and compare it to an item-total correlation. List the preliminary steps essential for scale construction, beginning with item development. Name the type(s; e.g., reliability, validity) of psychometric evaluation that item analytic procedures assess. Identify threats to the interpretation of item-total correlations and alpha coefficients. Make decisions about item retention, deletion, and revision that balances statistical output with construct definitions. 7.1.2 Planning for Practice In each of these lessons I provide suggestions for practice that allow you to select one or more problems that are graded in difficulty. The least complex is to change the random seed in the research and rework the problem demonstrated in the lesson. The results should map onto the ones obtained in the lecture. The second option involves utilizing one of the simulated datasets available in this OER. The last lesson in the OER contains three simulations that could be used for all of the statistics-based practice suggestions. Especially if you started with one of these examples in an earlier lesson, I highly recommend you continue with that. Alternatively, Lewis and Neville’s (2015) Gendered Racial Microaggressions Scale for Black Women will be used in the lessons on exploratory factor analysis; Keum et al.’s Gendered Racial Microaggressions Scale for Asian American Women (Keum et al., 2018) will be used in the lessons on confirmatory factor analysis; and Conover et al.’s (2017) Ableist Microaggressions Scale is used in the lesson on invariance testing. Any of these would be suitable for the PCA and PAF homework assignments. As a third option, you are welcome to use data to which you have access and is suitable for PCA. In any case, please plan to: Produce alpha coefficients, average inter-item correlations, and corrected item-total correlations for the total and subscales, separately. Produce correlations between the individual items of one subscale and the subscale scores of all other scales. Draft an APA style results section with an accompanying table. In my example there were only two subscales. If you have more, you will need to compare each subscale with all the others. For example, if you had three subscales: A, B, C, you would need to compare A/B, B/C, and A/C. 7.1.3 Readings &amp; Resources In preparing this chapter, I drew heavily from the following resource(s). Other resources are cited (when possible, linked) in the text with complete citations in the reference list. Green &amp; Salkind (2017). Lesson 38: Item analysis using the reliability Procedure. In S.B. Green and N.J. Salkind’s, “Using SPSS for Windows and Macintosh: Analyzing and understanding data (8th ed). New York: Pearson. Even though the operation of the chapter uses SPSS, the narration of the “what” and “why” of item analysis is clear and concise. Further, I have not found another chapter (not even in psychometrics texts) that addresses this as completely. Szymanski, D. M., &amp; Bissonette, D. (2020). Perceptions of the LGBTQ College Campus Climate Scale: Development and psychometric evaluation. Journal of Homosexuality, 67(10), 1412–1428. https://doi.org/10.1080/00918369.2019.1591788 The research vignette for this lesson. 7.1.4 Packages The packages used in this lesson are embedded in this code.

The goal is to select a set of items that yields a summary score (total or mean) that is strongly related to the construct identified and defined in the scale. Item analysis is somewhat limiting because we usually cannot relate our items to a direct (external) measure of a construct to select our items. Instead, we trust (term used lightly) that the items we have chosen, together, represent the construct and we make decisions about the relative strength of each item’s correlation to the total score. This makes it imperative that we look to both statistics and our construct definition (e.g., how well does each item map onto the construct definition) If this is initial scale development, the researchers are wise to write more items than needed so that there is flexibility in selecting items with optimal functioning. Szymanski and Bissonette (2020) do this. Their article narrates how they began with 36 items, narrowed it to 24, and – on the basis of subject matter expertise and peer review – further narrowed it to 10. The reduction of additional items happened on the basis of exploratory factor analysis. 7.2.1 Workflow for Item Analysis Image of workflow for item analyis for survey development. Step I: Calculate corrected item-total correlations. This involves: Reverse-scoring items that are negatively worded. Ensuring proper formatting of variables (i.e., numerical and integer formats). Evaluating the corrected item-total correlations (“r.drop” in the psych::alpha function) Consider deleting items with low item-total correlations. Consider the how deleting items might create too narrow of a construct definition. If so, hesitate before deleting. Re-run and re-evaluate the r.drop values and alpha coefficients after each change. This is an interative process and may involved “adding back” previously deleted items. Calculate correlations of items with other subscale scores. Calculate the mean scores for each of the subscales of a measure. Focusing on one subscale at a time, correlate each of the subscale’s items with the total score of all the other subscales. Compare the corrected item-total correlations to the correlations of items with other subscale scores. The correted item-total correlations should be stronger/higher than the correlations of items with other scales’ subscores. 7.3 Research Vignette The research vignette for this lesson is the development and psychometric evaluation of the Perceptions of the LGBTQ College Campus Climate Scale (Szymanski &amp; Bissonette, 2020). The scale is six items with responses rated on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Higher scores indicate more negative perceptions of the LGBTQ campus climate. Szymanski and Bissonette (2020) have suggested that the psychometric evaluation supports using the scale in its entirety or as subscales. Each item is listed below with its variable name in parentheses: College response to LGBTQ students: My university/college is cold and uncaring toward LGBTQ students. (cold) My university/college is unresponsive to the needs of LGBTQ students. (unresponsive) My university/college provides a supportive environment for LGBTQ students. (unsupportive) this item must be reverse-scored LGBTQ Stigma: Negative attitudes toward LGBTQ persons are openly expressed on my university/college campus. (negative) Heterosexism, homophobia, biphobia, transphobia, and cissexism are visible on my university/college campus. (heterosexism) LGBTQ students are harassed on my university/college campus. (harassed) A preprint of the article is available at ResearchGate. Below is the script for simulating item-level data from the factor loadings, means, and sample size presented in the published article. Because data is collected at the item level (and I want this resource to be as practical as possible, I have simulated the data for each of the scales at the item level. Simulating the data involved using factor loadings, means, and correlations between the scales. Because the simulation will produce “out-of-bounds” values, the code below rescales the scores into the range of the Likert-type scaling and rounds them to whole values. Five additional scales were reported in the Szymanski and Bissonette article (2020). Unfortunately, I could not locate factor loadings for all of them; and in two cases, I used estimates from a more recent psychometric analysis. When the individual item and their factor loadings are known, I assigned names based on item content (e.g., “lo_energy”) rather than using item numbers (e.g., “PHQ4”). When I am doing psychometric analyses, I prefer item-level names so that I can quickly see (without having to look up the item names) how the items are behaving. While the focus of this series of chapters is on the LGBTQ Campus Climate scale, this simulated data might be useful to you in one or more of the suggestions for practice (e.g., examining the psychometric characteristics of one or the other scales). The scales, their original citation, and information about how I simulated data for each are listed below. Sexual Orientation-Based Campus Victimization Scale (Herek, 1993) is a 9-item item scale with Likert scaling ranging from 0 (never) to 3 (two or more times). Because I was not able to locate factor loadings from a psychometric evaluation, I simulated the data by specifying a 0.8 as a standardized factor loading for each of the items. College Satisfaction Scale (Helm et al., 1998) is a 5-item scale with Likert scaling ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Higher scores represent greater college satisfaction. Because I was not able to locate factor loadings from a psychometric evaluation, I simulated the data by specifying a 0.8 as a standardized factor loading for each of the items. Institutional and Goals Commitment (Pascarella &amp; Terenzini, 1980) is a 6-item subscale from a 35-item measure assessing academic/social integration and institutional/goal commitment (5 subscales total). The measure had with Likert scaling ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Higher scores on the institutional and goals commitment subscale indicate greater intentions to persist in college. Data were simulated using factor loadings in the source article. GAD-7 (Spitzer et al., 2006) is a 7-item scale with Likert scaling ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). Higher scores indicate more anxiety. I simulated data by estimating factor loadings from Brattmyr et al. (2022). PHQ-9 (Kroenke et al., 2001) is a 9-item scale with Likert scaling ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). Higher scores indicate higher levels of depression. I simulated data by estimating factor loadings from Brattmyr et al. (2022). #Entering the intercorrelations, means, and standard deviations from the journal article Szymanski_generating_model &lt;- &#39; #measurement model CollegeResponse =~ .88*cold + .73*unresponsive + .73*supportive Stigma =~ .86*negative + .76*heterosexism + .71*harassed Victimization =~ .8*Vic1 + .8*Vic2 + .8*Vic3 + .8*Vic4 + .8*Vic5 + .8*Vic6 + .8*Vic7 + .8*Vic8 + .8*Vic9 CollSat =~ .8*Sat1 + .8*Sat2 + .8*Sat3 + .8*Sat4 + .8*Sat5 Persistence =~ .69*graduation_importance + .63*right_decision + .62*will_register + .59*not_graduate + .45*undecided + .44*grades_unimportant Anxiety =~ .851*nervous + .887*worry_control + .894*much_worry + 674*cant_relax + .484*restless + .442*irritable + 716*afraid Depression =~ .798*anhedonia + .425*down + .591*sleep + .913*lo_energy + .441*appetite + .519*selfworth + .755*concentration + .454*too_slowfast + .695*s_ideation #Means CollegeResponse ~ 2.71*1 Stigma ~3.61*1 Victimization ~ 0.11*1 CollSat ~ 5.61*1 Persistence ~ 4.41*1 Anxiety ~ 1.45*1 Depression ~1.29*1 #Correlations CollegeResponse ~~ .58*Stigma CollegeResponse ~~ -.25*Victimization CollegeResponse ~~ -.59*CollSat CollegeResponse ~~ -.29*Persistence CollegeResponse ~~ .17*Anxiety CollegeResponse ~~ .18*Depression Stigma ~~ .37*Victimization Stigma ~~ -.41*CollSat Stigma ~~ -.19*Persistence Stigma ~~ .27*Anxiety Stigma ~~ .24*Depression Victimization ~~ -.22*CollSat Victimization ~~ -.04*Persistence Victimization ~~ .23*Anxiety Victimization ~~ .21*Depression CollSat ~~ .53*Persistence CollSat ~~ -.29*Anxiety CollSat ~~ -.32*Depression Persistence ~~ -.22*Anxiety Persistence ~~ -.26*Depression Anxiety ~~ .76*Depression &#39; set.seed(240218) dfSzy &lt;- lavaan::simulateData(model = Szymanski_generating_model, model.type = &quot;sem&quot;, meanstructure = T, sample.nobs=646, standardized=FALSE) #used to retrieve column indices used in the rescaling script below col_index &lt;- as.data.frame(colnames(dfSzy)) #The code below loops through each column of the dataframe and assigns the scaling accordingly #Rows 1 thru 6 are the Perceptions of LGBTQ Campus Climate Scale #Rows 7 thru 15 are the Sexual Orientation-Based Campus Victimization Scale #Rows 16 thru 20 are the College Satisfaction Scale #Rows 21 thru 26 are the Institutional and Goals Commitment Scale #Rows 27 thru 33 are the GAD7 #Rows 34 thru 42 are the PHQ9 for(i in 1:ncol(dfSzy)){ if(i &gt;= 1 &amp; i &lt;= 6){ dfSzy[,i] &lt;- scales::rescale(dfSzy[,i], c(1, 7)) } if(i &gt;= 7 &amp; i &lt;= 15){ dfSzy[,i] &lt;- scales::rescale(dfSzy[,i], c(0, 3)) } if(i &gt;= 16 &amp; i &lt;= 20){ dfSzy[,i] &lt;- scales::rescale(dfSzy[,i], c(1, 7)) } if(i &gt;= 21 &amp; i &lt;= 26){ dfSzy[,i] &lt;- scales::rescale(dfSzy[,i], c(1, 5)) } if(i &gt;= 27 &amp; i &lt;= 33){ dfSzy[,i] &lt;- scales::rescale(dfSzy[,i], c(0, 3)) } if(i &gt;= 34 &amp; i &lt;= 42){ dfSzy[,i] &lt;- scales::rescale(dfSzy[,i], c(0, 3)) } } #rounding to integers so that the data resembles that which was collected library(tidyverse) dfSzy &lt;- dfSzy %&gt;% round(0) #quick check of my work #psych::describe(dfSzy) #Reversing the supportive item on the Perceptions of LGBTQ Campus Climate Scale so that the exercises will be consistent with the format in which the data was collected dfSzy &lt;- dfSzy %&gt;% dplyr::mutate(supportiveNR = 8 - supportive) #Reversing three items on the Institutional and Goals Commitments scale so that the exercises will be consistent with the format in which the data was collected dfSzy &lt;- dfSzy %&gt;% dplyr::mutate(not_graduateNR = 8 - not_graduate)%&gt;% dplyr::mutate(undecidedNR = 8 - undecided)%&gt;% dplyr::mutate(grades_unimportantNR = 8 - grades_unimportant) dfSzy &lt;- dplyr::select(dfSzy, -c(supportive, not_graduate, undecided, grades_unimportant)) The optional script below will let you save the simulated data to your computing environment as either an .rds object (preserves any formatting you might do) or a.csv file (think “Excel lite”). # to save the df as an .rds (think &#39;R object&#39;) file on your computer; # it should save in the same file as the .rmd file you are working # with saveRDS(dfSzy, &#39;SzyDF.rds&#39;) bring back the simulated dat from # an .rds file dfSzy &lt;- readRDS(&#39;SzyDF.rds&#39;) # write the simulated data as a .csv write.table(dfSzy, # file=&#39;SzyDF.csv&#39;, sep=&#39;,&#39;, col.names=TRUE, row.names=FALSE) bring # back the simulated dat from a .csv file dfSzy &lt;- # read.csv(&#39;SzyDF.csv&#39;, header = TRUE) Although Szymanski and Bissonette report inter-item correlations, it does not appear that they used item analysis to guide their selection of items. In fact, it is not necessary to do so. I teach item analysis because I think it provides a conceptual grounding for future lessons on exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. 7.4 Step I: Corrected item-total correlations Image of the first step in the workflow for item analyis for survey development. You might think of corrected item-total correlations as form a within-scale of convergent validity. If needed, transform any items (i.e., reverse-coding) and calculate a total score. Calculate corrected item-total correlations by correlating each item to the total score excluding the item being evaluated. to the degree that the item total represents the construct of interest, the items should be strongly correlated with the corrected total score. Make decisions about items and scales. For items that have low or negative correlations consider deletion, consider revision (requires new data collection). Each time an item is deleted, the item analysis needs to be repeated because it changes the total-scale score. In fact, it’s a very iterative process. At times, researchers “add back” a previously deleted item (once others are deleted) because with each deletion/addition the statistical construct definition is evolving. In multidimensional scales, if the total-scale score is ever used, researchers should conduct item analyses separately for both the total- and the sub- scale scores. There are reasons to not “blindly follow the results of an item analysis” (Green &amp; Salkind, 2017). Method factors (aka method effects) are common methods that are irrelevant to the characteristics or traits being measured – yet when analyzed they share variance. Examples of these include negatively word items and common phrasing such as “My supervisor tells me” versus “I receive feedback” (Chyung, Swanson, et al., 2018). Adequacy of construct representation. That is, how broad is the construct and to what degree do the items represent the entire construct? Threats to the adequacy of the construct representation include: Writing items on a particular, narrow, aspect of the construct, ignoring others. Retaining items that are strongly correlated while deleting those that whose correlations are less strong (although they represent a different aspect of the construct). This means we should think carefully and simultaneously about: statistical properties of the item and overall scale, construct definition, scale structure (unidimensional? multidimensional? hierarchical?). 7.4.1 Data Prep Let’s do the operational work to get all the pieces we need: Reverse-code the supportive variable. From the raw data calculate total-scale score, college response subscale, stigma subscale. The result is dataset with the item-level data and the three mean scores (total, college response, stigma). When we review the information about this scale, we learn that the supportive item is scaled in the opposite direction of the rest of the items. That is, a higher score on supportive would indicate a positive perception of the campus climate for LGBTQ individuals whereas higher scores on the remaining items indicate a more negative perception. Before moving forward, we must reverse score this item. In doing this, I will briefly note that in this case I have given my variables one-word names that represent each item. Many researchers (including myself) will often give variable names that are alpha numerical: LGBTQ1, LGBTQ2, LGBTQn. Either is acceptable. In the psychometrics case, I find the the one-word names to be useful shortcuts as I begin to understand the inter-item relations. In reverse-scoring the supportive item, I will rename it “unsupportive” as an indication of its reversed direction. dfSzy &lt;- dfSzy %&gt;% dplyr::mutate(unsupportive = 8 - supportiveNR) #scaling 1 to 7; so we subtract from 8 # psych::describe(dfSzy) Next, we score the items. In our simulation, we have no missing data. Using an available information approach (AIA; (Parent, 2013)) where it is common to allow 20-25% missingness, we might allow the total-scale score to calculate if there is one variable missing. I am inclined to also score the subscales if there is one missing; thus I set the thresshold at 66%. The mean_n() function in the sjstats packages is especially helpul for this. LGBTQvars &lt;- c(&quot;cold&quot;, &quot;unresponsive&quot;, &quot;negative&quot;, &quot;heterosexism&quot;, &quot;harassed&quot;, &quot;unsupportive&quot;) ResponseVars &lt;- c(&quot;cold&quot;, &quot;unresponsive&quot;, &quot;unsupportive&quot;) Stigmavars &lt;- c(&quot;negative&quot;, &quot;heterosexism&quot;, &quot;harassed&quot;) dfSzy$Total &lt;- sjstats::mean_n(dfSzy[, LGBTQvars], 0.8) #will create the mean for each individual if 80% of variables are present (this means there must be at least 5 of 6) dfSzy$Response &lt;- sjstats::mean_n(dfSzy[, ResponseVars], 0.66) #will create the mean for each individual if 66% of variables are present (in this case 1 variable can be missing) dfSzy$Stigma &lt;- sjstats::mean_n(dfSzy[, Stigmavars], 0.66) #will create the mean for each individual if 66% of variables are present (in this case 1 variable can be missing) # If the scoring code above does not work for you, try the format # below which involves inserting to periods in front of the variable # list. One example is provided. dfLewis$Belonging &lt;- # sjstats::mean_n(dfLewis[, ..Belonging_vars], 0.80) While we are at it, let’s just create tiny dfs with just our variables of interest.

The easiest way to do this is apply the alpha() function to a tiny df with the variables in that particular scale or subscale. Any variables should be pre-reversed.

Further, the average inter-item correlation (average_r) is .28. And just hold up a minute, I thought you told us alpha was bad! While it is less than ideal, we still use it all the time: keeping in mind its relative value (does it increase/decrease, holding other things [like sample size] constant) and examining alpha alternatives (such as we obtained from the omega output) Why alpha in this context? Its information about consistency is essential. In evaluating a scale’s reliability we do want to know if items (unidimensionally or across subscales) are responding consistently high/middle/low. We take note of two columns: r.cor is the correlation between the item and the total-scale score with the row-item included. When our focus is on the contribution of a specific item, this information is not helpful since this column gets “extra credit” for the redundancy of the duplicated item. r.drop is the corrected item-total correlation. This is the better choice because it excludes the row-item being evaluated (eliminating the redundancy) prior to conducting the correlation. Looking at the two columns, notice that the r.drop correlations are lower. This is the more honest correlation of the item with the other items. In item analysis, we look for items that have relatively high (assessing redundancy or duplication) of items and relatively low (indicating they are unlike the other items) values. If we thought an item was problematic, we could eliminate it and rerun the analysis. Because we are looking at a list of items that “made the cut,” we don’t have any items that are concerningly high or low. For demonstration purposes, though, the corrected item-total correlation (r.drop) of the harassed variable was the lowest (0.40). Let’s re-run the analysis excluding this item. minus_harassed &lt;- dplyr::select(dfSzy, cold, unresponsive, unsupportive, negative, heterosexism) psych::alpha(minus_harassed) Reliability analysis Call: psych::alpha(x = minus_harassed) raw_alpha std.alpha G6(smc) average_r S/N ase mean sd median_r 0.67 0.67 0.64 0.29 2 0.021 4 0.65 0.25 95% confidence boundaries lower alpha upper Feldt 0.63 0.67 0.71 Duhachek 0.63 0.67 0.71 Reliability if an item is dropped: raw_alpha std.alpha G6(smc) average_r S/N alpha se var.r med.r cold 0.58 0.58 0.53 0.26 1.4 0.027 0.0060 0.22 unresponsive 0.62 0.62 0.56 0.29 1.6 0.025 0.0079 0.25 unsupportive 0.61 0.61 0.56 0.28 1.6 0.025 0.0072 0.25 negative 0.65 0.64 0.58 0.31 1.8 0.022 0.0093 0.30 heterosexism 0.64 0.64 0.58 0.31 1.8 0.023 0.0097 0.30 Item statistics n raw.r std.r r.cor r.drop mean sd cold 646 0.72 0.71 0.61 0.50 4.1 1.03 unresponsive 646 0.66 0.66 0.53 0.43 4.3 0.99 unsupportive 646 0.67 0.67 0.55 0.45 3.7 0.98 negative 646 0.63 0.62 0.46 0.37 4.0 1.04 heterosexism 646 0.60 0.62 0.47 0.38 4.0 0.90 Non missing response frequency for each item 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 miss cold 0.00 0.04 0.22 0.40 0.23 0.09 0.00 0 unresponsive 0.00 0.03 0.17 0.37 0.33 0.09 0.01 0 unsupportive 0.01 0.07 0.35 0.37 0.17 0.02 0.01 0 negative 0.01 0.07 0.23 0.39 0.24 0.05 0.00 0 heterosexism 0.00 0.03 0.24 0.43 0.26 0.03 0.00 0 The alpha \\((\\alpha = 0.67)\\) decreases; the overall inter-item correlations increase, slightly (average_r; 0.29). This decrease in alpha is an example of how sample size can effect the result. Examining item-level statistics, we do see greater variability (0.37 to 0.50) in the corrected item-total correlations (r.drop). What might this mean? The item we dropped (harassed) may be clustering with negative and heterosexism in a subordinate factor (think subscale). Although item analysis is more of a tool in assessing reliability, the statistical information that harassed provided may broaden the construct definition (definitions are a concern of validity) of perceptions of campus climate such that it is necessary to ground/anchor negative and heterosexism. Tentative conclusion: there is evidence that this is not a unidimensional measure. Let’s move on to inspect similar data for each of the subscales. We’ll start with the College Response subscale.

Examining the corrected item-total correlations (r.drop) indicates strong correlations between the row-item with the remaining variables (0.45 to 0.50). Let’s examine at the Stigma subscale.

In contrast, the inter-item correlation (average_r) is a bit higher than the same for the total scale score (0.36 versus 0.28). Examining the corrected item-total correlations (r.drop) indicates a strong correlation between the row-item with the remaining variables (0.43 to 0.44). In addition to needing strong inter-item correlations (which we just assessed) we want the individual items to correlate more strongly with themselves than with the other scale. Let’s do that next. 7.5 Step II: Correlating Items with Other Scale Totals You might think of this step as analyzing a within-scale version of discriminant validity. That is, we do not want individual items from one scale to correlate more highly with subscale scores of other scales, than it does with its own. Image of the second step in the workflow for item analyis for survey development. Calculate scale scores for each of the subscales of a measure. Focusing on one subscale at a time, correlate each of the subscale’s items with the total scores of all the other subscales. Comparing to the results of Step I’s corrected item-total process, each item should have stronger correlations with its own items (i.e., the corrected item-total correlations) than with the other subscale total scores. In this first analysis, we will correlate the individual items from the College Response subscale to the Stigma subscale score. apaTables::apa.cor.table(dfSzy[c(&quot;cold&quot;, &quot;unresponsive&quot;, &quot;unsupportive&quot;, &quot;Stigma&quot;)]) Means, standard deviations, and correlations with confidence intervals Variable M SD 1 2 3 1. cold 4.11 1.03 2. unresponsive 4.31 0.99 .40** [.34, .47] 3. unsupportive 3.69 0.98 .42** .35** [.36, .49] [.28, .42] 4.

We want the corrected item-total correlations of the College Response scale (0.45 to 0.50; retrieved from the r.drop column above)to be higher than their correlations with the Stigma scale (0.28 to 0.33) with all three items). These items follow the pattern. Let’s examine the individual items from the Stigma scale with the College Response subscale score. apaTables::apa.cor.table(dfSzy[c(&quot;negative&quot;, &quot;heterosexism&quot;, &quot;harassed&quot;, &quot;Response&quot;)]) Means, standard deviations, and correlations with confidence intervals Variable M SD 1 2 3 1. negative 3.96 1.04 2. heterosexism 4.00 0.90 .37** [.30, .43] 3. harassed 3.91 1.07 .36** .35** [.29, .42] [.28, .42] 4.

Similarly, the corrected item-total correlations (i.e., r.drop) from the Stigma subscale (0.43 to 0.44) are stronger than their correlation with the College Response subsale (0.27 to 0.29). 7.6 Step III: Interpreting and Writing up the Results Now it’s time to make sense of the results. Here’s a reminder from the workflow: Image of the third step in the workflow for item analyis for survey development. Tabling these results can be really useful to present them effectively. As is customary in APA style tables, when the item is in bold, the value represents its relationship with its own factor. These values come from the corrected item-total (r.drop) values where the item is singled out and correlated with the remaining items in its subscale. Item-Total Correlations of Items with their Own and Other Subscales Variables College Response Stigma cold .50 0.33 unresponsive .45 0.28 unsupportive .46 0.26 negative 0.29 0.44 heterosexism 0.29 0.44 harassed 0.27 0.43 Although I pitched this type of item-analysis as reliability, to some degree it assesses within-scale convergent and discriminant validity because we can see the item relates more strongly to members of its own scale (higher correlation coefficients indicate convergence) than to the subscale scores of the other scales. When this pattern occurs, we can argue that the items discriminate well. Results Item analyses were conducted on the six items hypothesized to assess perceptions of campus climate for members of the LGBTQ community. To assess the within-scale convergent and discriminant validity of the College Response and Stigma subscales, each item was correlated with its own scale (with the item removed) and with the other subscale (see Table 1). In all cases, items were more highly correlated with their own scale than with the other scale. Coefficient alphas were 0.66, 0.63, and 0.70 for the College Response, Stigma, and total-scale scores, respectively. We concluded that the within-scale convergent and discriminant validity of this measure is strong. For your consideration: You are at your dissertation defense. For one of your measures, the Cronbach’s alpha is .45. A committee member asks, “So why was the alpha coefficient so low?” On the basis of what you have learned in this lesson, how do you respond? 7.7 A Conversation with Dr. Szymanski Doctoral students Julian Williams (Industrial-Organizational Psychology), Jaylee York (Clinical Psychology), and I were able to interview the first author (Dawn Szymanski, PhD) about the article (Szymanski &amp; Bissonette, 2020) and what it means. Here’s a direct link to that interview. Among other things, we asked: How were you able to create such an efficient (6 items) survey? What were the decisions around a potential third factor of visibility? What would you say to senior leadership on a college campus (where there hiring policies that discriminate against LGBTQIA+ applicants) who will acknowledge the research that indicates that the existence of such policies are associated with reduced well-being for members of the LGBTQIA+ community but who insists that their campus is different? How would you like to see the article used? 7.8 Practice Problems In each of these lessons I provide suggestions for practice that allow you to select one or more problems that are graded in difficulty. For this lesson, please locate item-level data for a scale that has the potential for at least two subscales and a total-scale score. Ideally, you selected such data for practice from the prior lesson. Then, please examine the following: produce alpha coefficients, average inter-item correlations, and corrected item-total correlations for the total and subscales, separately produce correlations between the individual items of one subscale and the subscale scores of all other scales draft an APA style results section with an accompanying table. In my example, there were only two subscales. If you have more, you will need to compare each subscale with all the others. For example, if you had three subscales: A, B, C, you would need to compare A/B, B/C, and A/C. 7.8.1 Problem #1: Play around with this simulation. Copy the script for the simulation and then change (at least) one thing in the simulation to see how it impacts the results. If item analysis is new to you, copy the script for the simulation and then change (at least) one thing in the simulation to see how it impacts the results. Perhaps you just change the number in “set.seed(210827)” from 210827 to something else. Your results should parallel those obtained in the lecture, making it easier for you to check your work as you go. 7.8.2 Problem #2: Use raw data from the ReCentering Psych Stats survey on Qualtrics.

Consider conducting the analyses on one of these scales or merging them together and imagining subscales according to identity/group (LGBTQ, Black, non-Black, disability, international) or College Response and Stigma across the different groups. library(tidyverse) # only have to run this ONCE to draw from the same Qualtrics # account...but will need to get different token if you are changing # between accounts library(qualtRics) # qualtrics_api_credentials(api_key = # &#39;mUgPMySYkiWpMFkwHale1QE5HNmh5LRUaA8d9PDg&#39;, base_url = # &#39;spupsych.az1.qualtrics.com&#39;, overwrite = TRUE, install = TRUE) QTRX_df &lt;- qualtRics::fetch_survey(surveyID = &quot;SV_b2cClqAlLGQ6nLU&quot;, time_zone = NULL, verbose = FALSE, label = FALSE, convert = FALSE, force_request = TRUE, import_id = FALSE) climate_df &lt;- QTRX_df %&gt;% select(&quot;Blst_1&quot;, &quot;Blst_2&quot;, &quot;Blst_3&quot;, &quot;Blst_4&quot;, &quot;Blst_5&quot;, &quot;Blst_6&quot;, &quot;nBSoC_1&quot;, &quot;nBSoC_2&quot;, &quot;nBSoC_3&quot;, &quot;nBSoC_4&quot;, &quot;nBSoC_5&quot;, &quot;nBSoC_6&quot;, &quot;INTst_1&quot;, &quot;INTst_2&quot;, &quot;INTst_3&quot;, &quot;INTst_4&quot;, &quot;INTst_5&quot;, &quot;INTst_6&quot;, &quot;wDIS_1&quot;, &quot;wDIS_2&quot;, &quot;wDIS_3&quot;, &quot;wDIS_4&quot;, &quot;wDIS_5&quot;, &quot;wDIS_6&quot;, &quot;LGBTQ_1&quot;, &quot;LGBTQ_2&quot;, &quot;LGBTQ_3&quot;, &quot;LGBTQ_4&quot;, &quot;LGBTQ_5&quot;, &quot;LGBTQ_6&quot;) # Item numbers are supported with the following items: _1 &#39;My campus # unit provides a supportive environment for ___ students&#39; _2 # &#39;________ is visible in my campus unit&#39; _3 &#39;Negative attitudes # toward persons who are ____ are openly expressed in my campus # unit.&#39; _4 &#39;My campus unit is unresponsive to the needs of ____ # students.&#39; _5 &#39;Students who are_____ are harassed in my campus # unit.&#39; _6 &#39;My campus unit is cold and uncaring toward ____ # students.&#39; # Item 1 on each subscale should be reverse coded.

Explanation to grader 5 _____ Totals 30 _____ 7.9 Bonus Reel: Image of a filmstrip For our interpretation and results, I created the table by manually typing in the results. Since there were only two subscales, this was easy. However, it can be a very useful skill (and prevent typing errors) by leveraging R’s capabilities to build a table. The script below Creates a correlation matrix of the items of each scale and correlates them with the “other” subscale, separately for both subscales. Extracts the r.drop from each subscale Joins (adds more variables) the analyses across the corrected item-total and item-other subscale analyses Binds (adds more cases) the two sets of items together Resp_othR &lt;- psych::corr.test(dfSzy[c(&quot;negative&quot;, &quot;heterosexism&quot;, &quot;harassed&quot;, &quot;Response&quot;)]) #Run the correlation of the subscale and the items that are *not* on the subscale Resp_othR &lt;- as.data.frame(Resp_othR$r) #extracts the &#39;r&#39; matrix and makes it a df Resp_othR$Items &lt;- c(&quot;negative&quot;, &quot;heterosexism&quot;, &quot;harassed&quot;, &quot;Response&quot;) #Assigning names to the items Resp_othR &lt;- Resp_othR[!Resp_othR$Items == &quot;Response&quot;, ] #Removing the subscale score as a a row in the df Resp_othR[, &quot;Stigma&quot;] &lt;- NA #We need a column for this to bind the items later Resp_othR &lt;- dplyr::select(Resp_othR, Items, Response, Stigma) #All we need is the item name and the correlations with the subscales RESPalpha &lt;- as.data.frame(RESPalpha$item.stats) #Grabbing the alpha objet we created earlier and making it a df RESPalpha$Items &lt;- c(&quot;cold&quot;, &quot;unresponsive&quot;, &quot;unsupportive&quot;) Stig_othR &lt;- psych::corr.test(dfSzy[c(&quot;cold&quot;, &quot;unresponsive&quot;, &quot;unsupportive&quot;, &quot;Stigma&quot;)]) #Run the correlation of the subscale and the items that are *not* on the subscale Stig_othR &lt;- as.data.frame(Stig_othR$r) #extracts the &#39;r&#39; matrix and makes it a df Stig_othR$Items &lt;- c(&quot;cold&quot;, &quot;unresponsive&quot;, &quot;unsupportive&quot;, &quot;Stigma&quot;) #Assigning names to the items Stig_othR &lt;- Stig_othR[!Stig_othR$Items == &quot;Stigma&quot;, ] #Removing the subscale score as a a row in the df Stig_othR[, &quot;Response&quot;] &lt;- NA #We need a column for this to bind the items later Stig_othR &lt;- dplyr::select(Stig_othR, Items, Response, Stigma) #All we need is the item name and the correlations with the subscales STIGalpha &lt;- as.data.frame(STIGalpha$item.stats) #Grabbing the alpha objet we created earlier and making it a df STIGalpha$Items &lt;- c(&quot;negative&quot;, &quot;heterosexism&quot;, &quot;harassed&quot;) # Combining these four dfs ResponseStats &lt;- full_join(RESPalpha, Stig_othR, by = &quot;Items&quot;) ResponseStats$Response &lt;- ResponseStats$r.drop ResponseStats &lt;- dplyr::select(ResponseStats, Items, Response, Stigma) StigmaStats &lt;- full_join(STIGalpha, Resp_othR, by = &quot;Items&quot;) StigmaStats$Stigma &lt;- StigmaStats$r.drop StigmaStats &lt;- dplyr::select(StigmaStats, Items, Response, Stigma) ItemAnalyses &lt;- rbind(ResponseStats, StigmaStats) ItemAnalyses Items Response Stigma 1 cold 0.5041391 0.3258401 2 unresponsive 0.4490390 0.2783617 3 unsupportive 0.4644473 0.2581391 4 negative 0.2874243 0.4401670 5 heterosexism 0.2925477 0.4365623 6 harassed 0.2704033 0.4291150 # Writing them to a .csv file allows post-r formatting write.csv(ItemAnalyses, file = &quot;LGBTQ_Climate_ItemAnalyses.csv&quot;, sep = &quot;,&quot;, row.names = TRUE, col.names = TRUE) 7.10 Homeworked Example Screencast Link For more information about the data used in this homeworked example, please refer to the description and codebook located at the end of the introduction in first volume of ReCentering Psych Stats. As a brief review, this data is part of an IRB-approved study, with consent to use in teaching demonstrations and to be made available to the general public via the open science framework. Hence, it is appropriate to use in this context. You will notice there are student- and teacher- IDs. These numbers are not actual student and teacher IDs, rather they were further re-identified so that they could not be connected to actual people. Because this is an actual dataset, if you wish to work the problem along with me, you will need to download the ReC.rds data file from the Worked_Examples folder in the ReC_Psychometrics project on the GitHub. The course evaluation items can be divided into three subscales: Valued by the student includes the items: ValObjectives, IncrUnderstanding, IncrInterest Traditional pedagogy includes the items: ClearResponsibilities, EffectiveAnswers, Feedback, ClearOrganization, ClearPresentation Socially responsive pedagogy includes the items: InclusvClassrm, EquitableEval, MultPerspectives, DEIintegration In this homework focused on validity we will score the total scale and subscales, create a correlation matrix of our scales with a different scale (or item), formally test to see if correlation coefficients are statistically significantly different from each other, conduct a test of incremental validity. 7.10.1 Check and, if needed, format and score data big &lt;- readRDS(&quot;ReC.rds&quot;) With the next code I will create an item-level df with only the items used in the three scales. library(tidyverse) items &lt;- big%&gt;% dplyr::select (ValObjectives, IncrUnderstanding, IncrInterest, ClearResponsibilities, EffectiveAnswers, Feedback, ClearOrganization, ClearPresentation, MultPerspectives, InclusvClassrm, DEIintegration,EquitableEval) Next I check the structure of the data. str(items) Classes &#39;data.table&#39; and &#39;data.frame&#39;: 310 obs. of 12 variables: $ ValObjectives : int 5 5 4 4 5 5 5 5 4 5 ... $ IncrUnderstanding : int 2 3 4 3 4 4 5 2 4 5 ... $ IncrInterest : int 5 3 4 2 4 3 5 3 2 5 ... $ ClearResponsibilities: int 5 5 4 4 5 4 5 4 4 5 ... $ EffectiveAnswers : int 5 3 5 3 5 3 4 3 2 3 ... $ Feedback : int 5 3 4 2 5 NA 5 4 4 5 ... $ ClearOrganization : int 3 4 3 4 4 4 5 4 4 5 ... $ ClearPresentation : int 4 4 4 2 5 3 4 4 4 5 ... $ MultPerspectives : int 5 5 4 5 5 4 5 5 5 5 ... $ InclusvClassrm : int 5 5 5 5 5 4 5 5 4 5 ... $ DEIintegration : int 5 5 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 5 ... $ EquitableEval : int 5 5 3 5 5 3 5 5 3 5 ... - attr(*, &quot;.internal.selfref&quot;)=&lt;externalptr&gt; 7.10.2 Report alpha coefficients and average inter-item correlations for the total and subscales This task is completed in the next section. 7.10.3 Produce and interpret corrected item-total correlations for total and subscales, separately In the lecture, I created baby dfs of the subscales and ran the alphas on those; another option is to create lists of variables (i.e., variable vectors) and use that instead. We can later use those same variable vectors to score the items. 7.10.3.1 All Course Evaluation Items First, I will calculate the alpha coefficient and inter-item correlations for the total score representing the course evaluation items. psych::alpha(items) Reliability analysis Call: psych::alpha(x = items) raw_alpha std.alpha G6(smc) average_r S/N ase mean sd median_r 0.92 0.92 0.93 0.49 11 0.0065 4.3 0.61 0.48 95% confidence boundaries lower alpha upper Feldt 0.90 0.92 0.93 Duhachek 0.91 0.92 0.93 Reliability if an item is dropped: raw_alpha std.alpha G6(smc) average_r S/N alpha se var.r ValObjectives 0.92 0.92 0.93 0.51 11.3 0.0067 0.016 IncrUnderstanding 0.91 0.91 0.92 0.49 10.6 0.0070 0.016 IncrInterest 0.91 0.91 0.92 0.49 10.4 0.0070 0.018 ClearResponsibilities 0.91 0.91 0.92 0.48 10.0 0.0073 0.015 EffectiveAnswers 0.91 0.91 0.92 0.48 10.0 0.0074 0.016 Feedback 0.91 0.91 0.92 0.48 10.3 0.0071 0.018 ClearOrganization 0.91 0.91 0.92 0.48 10.2 0.0073 0.016 ClearPresentation 0.91 0.91 0.92 0.47 9.7 0.0076 0.015 MultPerspectives 0.91 0.91 0.92 0.48 10.0 0.0073 0.017 InclusvClassrm 0.91 0.91 0.92 0.49 10.6 0.0069 0.018 DEIintegration 0.92 0.92 0.93 0.52 11.8 0.0063 0.011 EquitableEval 0.91 0.91 0.93 0.49 10.5 0.0070 0.018 med.r ValObjectives 0.53 IncrUnderstanding 0.50 IncrInterest 0.48 ClearResponsibilities 0.48 EffectiveAnswers 0.48 Feedback 0.48 ClearOrganization 0.48 ClearPresentation 0.47 MultPerspectives 0.47 InclusvClassrm 0.52 DEIintegration 0.53 EquitableEval 0.48 Item statistics n raw.r std.r r.cor r.drop mean sd ValObjectives 309 0.59 0.61 0.55 0.53 4.5 0.61 IncrUnderstanding 309 0.71 0.70 0.67 0.64 4.3 0.82 IncrInterest 308 0.75 0.73 0.71 0.68 3.9 0.99 ClearResponsibilities 307 0.80 0.80 0.79 0.75 4.4 0.82 EffectiveAnswers 308 0.80 0.79 0.78 0.75 4.4 0.83 Feedback 304 0.75 0.75 0.72 0.69 4.2 0.88 ClearOrganization 309 0.79 0.77 0.75 0.72 4.0 1.08 ClearPresentation 309 0.85 0.84 0.83 0.80 4.2 0.92 MultPerspectives 305 0.79 0.80 0.78 0.75 4.4 0.84 InclusvClassrm 301 0.68 0.70 0.67 0.62 4.6 0.68 DEIintegration 273 0.51 0.53 0.49 0.42 4.5 0.74 EquitableEval 308 0.70 0.72 0.69 0.66 4.6 0.63 Non missing response frequency for each item 1 2 3 4 5 miss ValObjectives 0.00 0.01 0.03 0.39 0.57 0.00 IncrUnderstanding 0.01 0.04 0.07 0.44 0.45 0.00 IncrInterest 0.02 0.09 0.14 0.44 0.31 0.01 ClearResponsibilities 0.01 0.02 0.07 0.31 0.59 0.01 EffectiveAnswers 0.01 0.02 0.08 0.36 0.53 0.01 Feedback 0.01 0.05 0.10 0.39 0.46 0.02 ClearOrganization 0.04 0.07 0.10 0.41 0.38 0.00 ClearPresentation 0.02 0.05 0.07 0.40 0.46 0.00 MultPerspectives 0.02 0.02 0.08 0.33 0.56 0.02 InclusvClassrm 0.01 0.01 0.05 0.23 0.70 0.03 DEIintegration 0.00 0.01 0.10 0.22 0.67 0.12 EquitableEval 0.00 0.01 0.03 0.32 0.63 0.01 At the total scale level, \\(\\alpha = 0.92\\); the average inter-item correlations are 0.487; and the corrected item-total correlations (r.drop) range from 0.42 to 0.80.

To assess the within-scale convergent and discrimninant validity of these three subscales, each item was correlated with its own scale (with the item removed) and with the other course evaluation scales (see Table 1). For the Valued and Traditional Pedagogy dimensions, items were more highly correlated with their own scale than with the other scale. For the SCRPed subscale, two items (multiple perspectives, equitable evaluations) had higher correlations with Traditional Pedagogy than with their hypothesized subscale (Socially Responsive Pedagogy). Coefficient alphas were .77, .90, .81, and .92 for the Valued-by-the-Student, Traditional Pedagogy, Socially Responsive, and total-scale scores, respectively. We conclude that more work is needed to create distinct and stable subscales. 7.10.7 Explanation to grader REFERENCES "],["exploratory-factor-analysis-1.html", "EXPLORATORY FACTOR ANALYSIS", " EXPLORATORY FACTOR ANALYSIS The next two lessons are devoted to exploratory factor analysis. The two approaches are principal components analysis (PCA) and principal axis factoring (PAF). In truth, only PAF is considered factor analysis. I will explain why in the lesson. These approaches are loosely termed exploratory because the statistical process (not the researcher) produces the factor (think scale or subscale) and identifies which items belong to it. This is contrasted with confirmatory approaches (which use structural equation modeling) where the researcher assigns items to factors and analyzes the goodness of fit.

We will review the theoretical and technical aspects of PCA, we will work through a research vignette, and then consider the relationship of PCA to item analysis and reliability coefficients. Please note, although PCA is frequently grouped into EFA techniques, it is exploratory but it is not factor analysis. We’ll discuss the difference in the lecture. 8.1 Navigating this Lesson There are about two hours of lecture. If you work through the materials with me, I would be plan for an additional hour-and-a-half. While the majority of R objects and data you will need are created within the R script that sources the chapter, occasionally there are some that cannot be created from within the R framework. Additionally, sometimes links fail. All original materials are provided at the Github site that hosts the book. More detailed guidelines for ways to access all these materials are provided in the OER’s introduction 8.1.1 Learning Objectives Focusing on this week’s materials, make sure you can: Distinguish between PCA and PAF on several levels: which path diagram represents each best, and keywords associated with each: factor loadings, linear components, describe versus explain. Recognize/define an identity matrix – what test would you use to diagnose it? Recognize/define multicollinearity and singularity – what test would you use to diagnose it? Describe the pattern of “loadings” (i.e., the relative weights of an item on its own scale compared to other scales)that supports the structure of the instrument. Compare the results from item analysis and PCA. 8.1.2 Planning for Practice In each of these lessons I provide suggestions for practice that allow you to select one or more problems that are graded in difficulty. The least complex is to change the random seed in the research and rework the problem demonstrated in the lesson. The results should map onto the ones obtained in the lecture. The second option involves utilizing one of the simulated datasets available in this OER. The last lesson in the OER contains three simulations that could be used for all of the statistics-based practice suggestions. Especially if you started with one of these examples in an earlier lesson, I highly recommend you continue with that. Alternatively, Keum et al.’s Gendered Racial Microaggressions Scale for Asian American Women (2018) will be used in the lessons on confirmatory factor analysis and Conover et al.’s (2017) Ableist Microaggressions Scale is used in the lesson on invariance testing. Both of these would be suitable for the PCA and PAF homework assignments. As a third option, you are welcome to use data to which you have access and is suitable for PCA. These could include other vignettes from this OER, other simulated data, or your own data (presuming you have permission to use it). In any case, please plan to: Properly format and prepare the data. Conduct diagnostic tests to determine the suitability of the data for PCA. Conducting tests to guide the decisions about number of components to extract. Conducting orthogonal and oblique extractions (at least two each with different numbers of components). Selecting one solution and preparing an APA style results section (with table and figure). Compare your results in light of any other psychometrics lessons where you have used this data. 8.1.3 Readings &amp; Resources In preparing this chapter, I drew heavily from the following resource(s).

When the hashtags are removed, the script below will (a) check to see if the following packages are installed on your computer and, if not (b) install them. # will install the package if not already installed # if(!require(psych)){install.packages(&#39;psych&#39;)} # if(!require(tidyverse)){install.packages(&#39;tidyverse&#39;)} # if(!require(MASS)){install.packages(&#39;MASS&#39;)} # if(!require(sjstats)){install.packages(&#39;sjstats&#39;)} # if(!require(apaTables)){install.packages(&#39;apaTables&#39;)} # if(!require(qualtRics)){install.packages(&#39;qualtRics&#39;)} 8.2 Exploratory Principal Components Analysis The psychometric version of parsimony is seen in our attempt to describe (components) or to explain (factors) in the relationships between many observed variables in terms of a more limited set of components, latent factors, or dimensions. That is, we are trying to: understand the structure of a set of variables, construct a questionnaire to measure an underlying latent variable, and reduce a data set to a more manageable size (e.g., representing bundles of items as subscale scores) while retaining as much of the information as possible 8.2.1 Some Framing Ideas (in very lay terms) Exploratory versus confirmatory factor analysis. Both exploratory and confirmatory approaches to components/factor analysis are used in scale construction. Think of “scales” as being interchangeable with “factors” and “components.” That said, “factors” and “components” are not interchangeable terms. Exploratory: Even though we may have an a priori model in mind, we explore the structure of the items by using diagnostics (KMO, Barlett’s, determinant), factor extraction, and rotation to determine the number of scales (i.e., components or factors) that exist within the raw data or correlation matrix. The algorithms (including matrix algebra) determine the relationship of each item to its respective scales (i.e., components or factors). Confirmatory: Starting with an a priori theory, we specify the structure (i.e., number and levels of factors) and which items belong to factors. We use structural equation modeling as the framework. We evaluate the quality of the model with a number of fit indices. Within the exploratory category we will focus on two further distinctions (there are even more). The first is principal components analysis (PCA). The second is principal axis factoring (PAF). PAF is one of the approaches that is commonly termed “exploratory factor analysis” (EFA). In this first lesson we focus on the differences between PCA and EFA. Option #1/Component model: PCA approximates the correlation matrix in terms of the product of components where each is a weighted linear sum of the variables. In the figure below, note how the arrows in the components analysis (a path model) point from variables to the component. Perhaps an oversimplification, think of each of these as a predictor variable contributing to an outcome. Option #2/Factor model: EFA (and in the next lesson, PAF/principal axis factoring) approximates the correlation matrix by the product of the two factors; this approach presumes that the factors are the causes (rather than as consequences). In the figure below, note how the arrows in the factor analysis model (a structural model) point from latent variable (or factor) to the observed variables (items). Factor analysis has been termed causal modeling because the latent variables are theorized to cause the responses to the individual items. There are other popular approaches, including parallel analysis (which is what the authors used in this lesson’s research vignette). Well-crafted figures provide important clues to the analyses. In structural models, rectangles and squares indicate the presence of observed (also called manifest) variables. These are variables that have a column in the dataset. In our particular case, they are the responses to the 25 items in the GRMS. Circles or ovals represent latent variables or factors. These were never raw data, but are composed of the relations of variables that were collected. They are more complex than mean or sum scores. Rather, they represent what the variables that represent them share in common. Comparison of path models for PCA and EFA for our research vignette Our focus today is on the principal component analysis (PCA) approach to scale construction. 8.3 PCA Workflow Below is a screenshot of the workflow. The original document is located in the Github site that hosts the ReCentering Psych Stats: Psychometrics OER. Image of the workflow for PCA Steps in the process include: Creating an items only dataframe where any items are scaled in the same direction (e.g., negatively worded items are reverse-scored). Conducting tests that assess the statistical assumptions of PCA to ensure that the data is appropriate for PCA. Determining the number of components (think “subscales”) to extract. Conducting the component extraction – this process will likely occur iteratively, exploring orthogonal (uncorrelated/independent) and oblique (correlated)components, and changing the number of components to extract Because the intended audience for the ReCentering Psych Stats OER is the scientist-practitioner-advocate, this lesson focuses on the workflow and decisions. As you might guess, the details of PCA can be quite complex. Some important notions to consider that may not be obvious from lesson, are these: The values of component loadings are directly related to the correlation (similarly, the covariance) matrix between the items. Although I do not explain this in detail, nearly every analytic step attempts to convey this notion by presenting equivalent analytic options using the raw data and correlation matrix. PCA is about dimension reduction – our goal is fewer components (i.e., subscales) than there are items. In this lesson’s vignette there are 25 items on the scale and we will end up with 4 subscales. Principal component analysis is exploratory, but it is not “factor analysis.” Matrix algebra (e.g., using the transpose of a matrix, multiplying matrices together) plays a critical role in the analytic solution. 8.4 Research Vignette This lesson’s research vignette emerges from Lewis and Neville’s Gendered Racial Microaggressions Scale for Black Women (2015). The article reports on two separate studies that comprised the development, refinement, and psychometric evaluation of two parallel versions (stress appraisal, frequency) of the scale. Below, I simulate data from the final construction of the stress appraisal version as the basis of the lecture. Items were on a 6-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all stressful) to 5 (extremely stressful). Lewis and Neville (2015) reported support for a total scale score (25 items) and four subscales. Below, I list the four subscales along with the items and their abbreviation. At the outset, let me provide a content advisory. For those who hold this particular identity (or related identities) the content in the items may be upsetting. In other lessons, I often provide a variable name that gives an indication of the primary content of the item. In the case of the GRMS, I will simply provide an abbreviation of the subscale name and its respective item number. This will allow us to easily inspect the alignment of the item with its intended factor, and hopefully minimize discomfort. If you are not a member of this particular identity, I encourage you to learn about these microaggressions by reading the article in its entirety. Please do not ask members of this group to explain why these microaggressions are harmful or ask if they have encountered them. The four factors, number of items, and sample item are as follows: Assumptions of Beauty and Sexual Objectification (10 items) Unattractive because of size of butt (Obj1) Negative comments about size of facial features (Obj2) Imitated the way they think Black women speak (Obj3) Someone made me feel unattractive (Obj4) Negative comment about skin tone (Obj5) Someone assumed I speak a certain way (Obj6) Objectified me based on physical features(Obj7) Someone assumed I have a certain body type (Obj8; stress only) Made a sexually inappropriate comment (Obj9) Negative comments about my hair when natural (Obj10) Assumed I was sexually promiscuous (frequency only; not used in this simulation) Silenced and Marginalized (7 items) I have felt unheard (Marg1) My comments have been ignored (Marg2) Someone challenged my authority (Marg3) I have been disrespected in workplace (Marg4) Someone has tried to “put me in my place” (Marg5) Felt excluded from networking opportunities (Marg6) Assumed I did not have much to contribute to the conversation (Marg7) Strong Black Woman Stereotype (5 items) Someone assumed I was sassy and straightforward (Str1; stress only) I have been told that I am too independent (Str2) Someone made me feel exotic as a Black woman (Str2; stress only) I have been told that I am too assertive Assumed to be a strong Black woman Angry Black Woman Stereotype (3 items) Someone has told me to calm down (Ang1) Perceived to be “angry Black woman” (Ang2) Someone accused me of being angry when speaking calm (Ang3) Three additional scales were reported in the Lewis and Neville article (2015). Because (a) the focus of this lesson is on exploratory factor analytic approaches and, therefore, only requires item-level data for the scale, and (b) the article does not include correlations between the subscales/scales of all involved measures, I only simulated item-level data for the GRMS items. Below, I walk through the data simulation. This is not an essential portion of the lesson, but I will lecture it in case you are interested. None of the items are negatively worded (relative to the other items), so there is no need to reverse-score any items. Simulating the data involved using factor loadings, means, standard deviations, and correlations between the scales. Because the simulation will produce “out-of-bounds” values, the code below rescales the scores into the range of the Likert-type scaling and rounds them to whole values. # Entering the intercorrelations, means, and standard deviations from # the journal article LewisGRMS_generating_model &lt;- &quot; #measurement model Objectification =~ .69*Obj1 + .69*Obj2 + .60*Obj3 + .59*Obj4 + .55*Obj5 + .55*Obj6 + .54*Obj7 + .50*Obj8 + .41*Obj9 + .41*Obj10 Marginalized =~ .93*Marg1 + .81*Marg2 +.69*Marg3 + .67*Marg4 + .61*Marg5 + .58*Marg6 +.54*Marg7 Strong =~ .59*Str1 + .55*Str2 + .54*Str3 + .54*Str4 + .51*Str5 Angry =~ .70*Ang1 + .69*Ang2 + .68*Ang3 #Means Objectification ~ 1.85*1 Marginalized ~ 2.67*1 Strong ~ 1.61*1 Angry ~ 2.29*1 #Correlations Objectification ~~ .63*Marginalized Objectification ~~ .66*Strong Objectification ~~ .51*Angry Marginalized ~~ .59*Strong Marginalized ~~ .62*Angry Strong ~~ .61*Angry &quot; set.seed(240311) dfGRMS &lt;- lavaan::simulateData(model = LewisGRMS_generating_model, model.type = &quot;sem&quot;, meanstructure = T, sample.nobs = 259, standardized = FALSE) # used to retrieve column indices used in the rescaling script below col_index &lt;- as.data.frame(colnames(dfGRMS)) # The code below loops through each column of the dataframe and # assigns the scaling accordingly Rows 1 thru 26 are the GRMS items for (i in 1:ncol(dfGRMS)) { if (i &gt;= 1 &amp; i &lt;= 25) { dfGRMS[, i] &lt;- scales::rescale(dfGRMS[, i], c(0, 5)) } } # rounding to integers so that the data resembles that which was # collected library(tidyverse) dfGRMS &lt;- dfGRMS %&gt;% round(0) # quick check of my work psych::describe(dfGRMS) The optional script below will let you save the simulated data to your computing environment as either an .rds object (preserves any formatting you might do) or a .csv file (think “Excel lite”). An .rds file preserves all formatting to variables prior to the export and re-import. For the purpose of this chapter, you don’t need to do either. That is, you can re-simulate the data each time you work the problem. # to save the df as an .rds (think &#39;R object&#39;) file on your computer; # it should save in the same file as the .rmd file you are working # with saveRDS(dfGRMS, &#39;dfGRMS.rds&#39;) bring back the simulated dat # from an .rds file dfGRMS &lt;- readRDS(&#39;dfGRMS.rds&#39;) If you save the .csv file and bring it back in, you will lose any formatting (e.g., ordered factors will be interpreted as character variables). # write the simulated data as a .csv write.table(dfGRMS, # file=&#39;dfGRMS.csv&#39;, sep=&#39;,&#39;, col.names=TRUE, row.names=FALSE) bring # back the simulated dat from a .csv file dfGRMS &lt;- read.csv # (&#39;dfGRMS.csv&#39;, header = TRUE) Before moving on, I want to acknowledge that (at their first drafting), I try to select research vignettes that have been published within the prior 5 years. With a publication date of 2015, this article clearly falls outside that range. I have continued to include it because (a) the scholarship is superior – especially as the measure captures an intersectional identity, (b) the article has been a model for research that follows (e.g., Keum et al’s (2018) Gendered Racial Microaggression Scale for Asian American Women), and (c) there is often a time lag between the initial publication of a psychometric scale and it’s use. A key reason I have retained the GRMS as a psychometrics research vignette is that in ReCentering Psych Stats: Multivariate Modeling, GRMS scales are used in a couple of more recently published research vignettes. 8.5 Working the Vignette Below we will create a correlation matrix of our items. Whether we are conducting PCA or PAF, the dimension-reduction we are looking for clusters of correlated items in the \\(R\\)-matrix. Essentially, these are (Field, 2012): Statistical entities that can be plotted as classification axes where coordinates of variables along each axis represent the strength of the relationship between that variable to each component (later, factor). Mathematical equations, resembling regression equations, where each variable is represented according to its relative weight. PCA in particular establishes which linear components exist within the data and how a particular variable might contribute to that component. Below is the correlation matrix of our items.

Using the correlation matrix helps us perceive how this is a structural analysis. That is, we are trying to see if our more parsimonious extraction (i.e., our dimension reduction) reproduces this original correlation matrix. In each of the analyses I will include code for running the analyses with raw data and the r-matrix. 8.5.1 Three Diagnostic Tests to Evaluate the Appropriateness of the Data for Component-or-Factor Analysis Below is a snip from the workflow to remind us where we are in the steps to PCA. Image of an excerpt from the workflow 8.5.1.1 Is my sample adequate for PCA? There have been a number of generic guidelines (some supported with empirical evidence, some not) about “how big” the sample size should be: 10-15 participants per variable 10 times as many participants as variables (Nunnally, 1978) 5 and 10 participants per variable up to 300 (Kass &amp; Tinsley, 1979) 300 (Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2007) 1000 = excellent, 300 = good, 100 = poor (Comrey &amp; Lee, 1992) Of course it is more complicated. Monte Carlo studies have shown that: if factor loadings are large (~.6), the solution is reliable regardless of size if communalities are large (~.6), relatively small samples (~100) are sufficient, but when they are lower (well below .5), then larger samples (&gt;500 are indicated). The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin index (KMO) is an index of sampling adequacy that can be used with the actual sample to let us know if the sample size is sufficient relative to the statistical characteristics of the data. If the KMO is below the recommendations, we should probably collect more data to see if it can achieve a satisfactory value. Kaiser’s 1974 recommendations were: bare minimum of .5 values between .5 and .7 as mediocre values between .7 and .8 as good values above .9 are superb Revelle has included a KMO test in the psych package. The function can use either raw or matrix data. Either way, the only variables in the matrix should be the items of interest. This means that everything else (e.g., total or subscale scores, ID numbers) should be removed. psych::KMO(dfGRMS) Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin factor adequacy Call: psych::KMO(r = dfGRMS) Overall MSA = 0.85 MSA for each item = Obj1 Obj2 Obj3 Obj4 Obj5 Obj6 Obj7 Obj8 Obj9 Obj10 Marg1 Marg2 Marg3 0.87 0.91 0.88 0.85 0.85 0.80 0.90 0.85 0.81 0.85 0.86 0.89 0.86 Marg4 Marg5 Marg6 Marg7 Str1 Str2 Str3 Str4 Str5 Ang1 Ang2 Ang3 0.86 0.90 0.89 0.84 0.83 0.85 0.82 0.74 0.84 0.78 0.76 0.81 # psych::KMO(GRMSmatrix) We examine the KMO values for both the overall matrix and the individual items. At the matrix level, our \\(KMO = .85\\), which falls into Kaiser’s definition of good. You can locate this value as the “Overall MSA.” At the item level, the KMO should be &gt; .50. Variables with values below .50 should be evaluated for exclusion from the analysis (or run the analysis with and without the variable and compare the difference). Because removing and adding variables impacts the KMO, be sure to re-evaluate the sampling adequacy if changes are made to the items (and/or sample size). At the item level, our KMO values range between .74 (Str4) and .91 (Obj2). Considering both item and matrix levels, we conclude that the sample size and the data are adequate for component (or factor) analysis. 8.5.1.2 Are the correlations among the variables large enough to be analyzed? Bartlett’s test lets us know if a matrix is an identity matrix. In an identity matrix all correlation coefficients (everything on the off-diagonal) would be 0.0 (and everything on the diagonal would be 1.0. A significant Barlett’s (i.e., \\(p &lt; .05\\)) tells that the \\(R\\)-matrix is not an identity matrix. That is, there are some relationships between variables that can be analyzed. The cortest.bartlett() function is in the psych package and can be run either from the raw data or R matrix formats. psych::cortest.bartlett(dfGRMS) #from the raw data R was not square, finding R from data $chisq [1] 1217.508 $p.value [1] 0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001107085 $df [1] 300 # raw data produces the warning &#39;R was not square, finding R from # data.&#39; This means nothing other than we fed it raw data and the # function is creating a matrix from which to do the analysis. # psych::cortest.bartlett(GRMSmatrix, n = 259) #if using the matrix, # must specify sample Our Bartlett’s test is significant: \\(\\chi^{2}(300)=1217.508, p &lt; .001\\). This means that our sample correlation matrix is statistically significantly different than an identity matrix and, therefore, supports a component-or-factor analytic approach for investigating the data. 8.5.1.3 Is there multicollinearity or singularity in my data? The determinant of the correlation matrix should be greater than 0.00001 (that would be 4 zeros, then the 1). If it is smaller than 0.00001 then we may have an issue with multicollinearity (i.e., variables that are too highly correlated) or singularity (variables that are perfectly correlated). The determinant function we use comes from base R. It is easiest to compute when the correlation matrix is the object. However, it is also possible to specify the command to work with the raw data. det(GRMSmatrix) [1] 0.007499909 # det(cor(dfGRMS))#if using the raw data With a value of 0.0075, our determinant is greater than the 0.00001 requirement. If it were not, then we could identify problematic variables (i.e., those correlating too highly with others; those not correlating sufficiently with others) and re-run the diagnostic statistics. 8.5.1.4 APA Style Summary So Far Data screening were conducted to determine the suitability of the data for this analyses. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy (KMO; Kaiser, 1970) represents the ratio of the squared correlation between variables to the squared partial correlation between variables. KMO ranges from 0.00 to 1.00; values closer to 1.00 indicate that the patterns of correlations are relatively compact and that component analysis should yield distinct and reliable components (Field, 2012). In our dataset, the KMO value was .85, indicating acceptable sampling adequacy. The Barlett’s Test of Sphericity examines whether the population correlation matrix resembles an identity matrix (Field, 2012). When the p value for the Bartlett’s test is &lt; .05, we are fairly certain we have clusters of correlated variables. In our dataset, \\(\\chi^{2}(300)=1217.508, p &lt; .001\\), indicating the correlations between items are sufficiently large enough for principal components analysis. The determinant of the correlation matrix alerts us to any issues of multicollinearity or singularity and should be larger than 0.00001. Our determinant was 0.0075, supporting the suitability of our data for analysis. 8.5.2 Principal Components Analysis Below is a snip from the workflow to remind us where we are in the steps to PCA. Image of an excerpt from the workflow We can use the principal() function from the psych package with raw or matrix data. We start by creating a principal components model that has the same number of components as there are variables in the data. This allows us to inspect the component’s eigenvalues and make decisions about which to extract. Note, this is different than actual factor analysis where you must extract fewer factors than variables (e.g., extracting 18 [an arbitray number] instead of 25). # All of the code sets below are functionally identical. They simply # swap out using the df or r-matrix, and whether I specify the number # of factors or write code to instruct R to calculate it. # pca1 &lt;- psych::principal(GRMSmatrix, nfactors=25,

7.9 Test of the hypothesis that 25 components are sufficient. The root mean square of the residuals (RMSR) is 0 with the empirical chi square 0 with prob &lt; NA Fit based upon off diagonal values = 1 The total variance for a particular variable will have two components: some of it will be share with other variables (common variance, h2) and some of it will be specific to that measure (unique variance, u2). Random variance is also specific to one item, but not reliably so. We can examine this most easily by examining the matrix (second screen). The columns PC1 thru PC25 are the (uninteresting at this point) unrotated loadings. PC stands for “principal component.” Although these don’t align with the specific items, at this point in the procedure, there are as many components as variables. Communalities are represented as \\(h^2\\). These are the proportions of common variance present in the variables. A variable that has no specific (or random) variance would have a communality of 1.0. If a variable shares none of its variance with any other variable its communality would be 0.0. Because we extracted the same number components as variables, they all equal 1.0. That is we have explained all the variance in each variable. When we specify fewer components, the value of the communalities will decrease. **Uniquenesses* are represented as \\(u2\\). These are the amount of unique variance for each variable. They are calculated as \\(1 - h^2\\) (or 1 minus the communality). Technically (at this point in the analysis where we have an equal number of components as items), they should all be zero, but the psych package is very “quantsy” and decimals are reported to the 15th and 16th decimal places! (hence the u2 for Q1 is -0.0000000000000006661338). The final column, com, represents item complexity. This is an indication of how well an item reflects a single construct. If it is 1.0 then the item loads only on one component, if it is 2.0, it loads evenly on two components, and so forth. For now, we can ignore this. I mostly wanted to reassure you that “com” is not “communality”; h2 is communality. Let’s switch to the first screen of output. Eigenvalues are displayed in the row called SS loadings (i.e., the sum of squared loadings). They represent the variance explained by the particular linear component. PC1 explains 5.37 units of variance (out of a possible 25, the total of components). As a proportion, this is 5.37/25 = 0.21 (reported in the Proportion Var row). 5.37/25 [1] 0.2148 Note: Cumulative Var is helpful in determining how many components we would like to retain to balance parsimony (where the goal is frequently “as few as possible”) with the amount of variance we want to explain. The eigenvalues are in descending order. If we were to use the eigenvalue &gt; 1.0 (i.e., “Kaiser’s”) criteria to determine how many components to extract, we would select 7. Joliffe’s critera was 0.7 (thus, we would select 14 components). Eigenvalues are only one criteria, let’s look at he scree plot. Scree plot: We can gain another view of how many components to extract by creating a scree plot. Eigenvalues are stored in the pca1 object’s variable, “values”. We can see all the values captured by this object with the names() function: names(pca1) [1] &quot;values&quot; &quot;rotation&quot; &quot;n.obs&quot; &quot;communality&quot; &quot;loadings&quot; [6] &quot;fit&quot; &quot;fit.off&quot; &quot;fn&quot; &quot;Call&quot; &quot;uniquenesses&quot; [11] &quot;complexity&quot; &quot;valid&quot; &quot;chi&quot; &quot;EPVAL&quot; &quot;R2&quot; [16] &quot;objective&quot; &quot;residual&quot; &quot;rms&quot; &quot;factors&quot; &quot;dof&quot; [21] &quot;null.dof&quot; &quot;null.model&quot; &quot;criteria&quot; &quot;STATISTIC&quot; &quot;PVAL&quot; [26] &quot;weights&quot; &quot;r.scores&quot; &quot;Vaccounted&quot; &quot;Structure&quot; &quot;scores&quot; Plotting the eigenvalues produces a scree plot. We can use this to further guage the number of factors we should extract. plot(pca1$values, type = &quot;b&quot;) #type = &#39;b&#39; gives us &#39;both&#39; lines and points; type = &#39;l&#39; gives lines and is relatively worthless We look for the point of inflexion. That is, where the baseline levels out into a plateau. It seems to me that there is only one clear component above the plateau. However, we see that components #5 and 5 flatten out, and then there is another drop. So it could be 1, 2, or 4. 8.5.3 Specifying the Number of Components Below is a snip from the workflow to remind us where we are in the steps to PCA. Image of an excerpt from the workflow Having determined the number of components, we re-run the analysis with this specification. Especially when researchers may not have a clear theoretical structure that guides the process, researchers may do this iteratively with varying numbers of factors. Lewis and Neville (J. A. Lewis &amp; Neville, 2015) examined solutions with 2, 3, 4, and 5 factors. Further, they used a parallel factor analysis, whereas we used a principal components analysis). # pca2 &lt;- psych::principal(GRMSmatrix, nfactors=4, rotate=&#39;none&#39;) pca2 &lt;- psych::principal(dfGRMS, nfactors = 4, rotate = &quot;none&quot;) #can copy prior script, but change nfactors and object name pca2 Principal Components Analysis Call: psych::principal(r = dfGRMS, nfactors = 4, rotate = &quot;none&quot;) Standardized loadings (pattern matrix) based upon correlation matrix PC1 PC2 PC3 PC4 h2 u2 com Obj1 0.52 -0.29 0.06 0.08 0.37 0.63 1.7 Obj2 0.55 -0.28 0.00 0.07 0.39 0.61 1.5 Obj3 0.49 -0.26 0.06 0.06 0.32 0.68 1.6 Obj4 0.52 -0.35 -0.09 0.02 0.40 0.60 1.8 Obj5 0.51 -0.29 0.09 -0.12 0.36 0.64 1.8 Obj6 0.40 -0.20 0.01 0.47 0.42 0.58 2.3 Obj7 0.56 -0.11 -0.03 0.06 0.32 0.68 1.1 Obj8 0.48 -0.40 -0.13 -0.25 0.47 0.53 2.6 Obj9 0.40 -0.28 0.16 -0.04 0.27 0.73 2.2 Obj10 0.42 -0.32 0.00 0.23 0.33 0.67 2.5 Marg1 0.58 0.31 -0.36 -0.26 0.63 0.37 2.7 Marg2 0.58 0.38 -0.08 -0.13 0.50 0.50 1.9 Marg3 0.51 0.23 -0.18 -0.23 0.40 0.60 2.1 Marg4 0.50 0.10 -0.35 -0.07 0.39 0.61 2.0 Marg5 0.56 0.19 -0.19 -0.20 0.43 0.57 1.8 Marg6 0.54 -0.01 -0.19 0.05 0.33 0.67 1.2 Marg7 0.41 0.21 -0.27 -0.08 0.29 0.71 2.4 Str1 0.43 0.12 0.45 -0.30 0.50 0.50 2.9 Str2 0.40 0.03 0.31 0.15 0.28 0.72 2.2 Str3 0.33 0.22 0.54 -0.08 0.45 0.55 2.1 Str4 0.29 0.03 0.48 -0.23 0.37 0.63 2.1 Str5 0.34 0.20 0.37 0.10 0.30 0.70 2.7 Ang1 0.35 0.40 0.27 0.14 0.37 0.63 3.0 Ang2 0.33 0.37 -0.10 0.57 0.57 0.43 2.5 Ang3 0.38 0.31 -0.04 0.37 0.38 0.62 2.9 PC1 PC2 PC3 PC4 SS loadings 5.37 1.71 1.54 1.22 Proportion Var 0.21 0.07 0.06 0.05 Cumulative Var 0.21 0.28 0.34 0.39 Proportion Explained 0.55 0.17 0.16 0.12 Cumulative Proportion 0.55 0.72 0.88 1.00 Mean item complexity = 2.1 Test of the hypothesis that 4 components are sufficient. The root mean square of the residuals (RMSR) is 0.06 with the empirical chi square 639.9 with prob &lt; 0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000056 Fit based upon off diagonal values = 0.89 Our eigenvalues/SS loadings remain the same. With 4 components, we explain 39% of the variance (we can see this in the “Cumulative Var” row. Communality is the proportion of common variance within a variable. Principal components analysis assumes that all variance is common. Before extraction, all variance was set at 1.0, therefore, changing from 25 to 4 components will change this value (\\(h2\\)) as well as its associated uniqueness (\\(u2\\)), which is calculated as “1.0 minus the communality.” The communalities (\\(h2\\)) and uniquenesses (\\(u2\\)) have changed. Now we see that 37% of the variance associate with Obj1 is common/shared (the \\(h2\\) value). Recall that we could represent this scale with all 25 items as components, but we want a more parsimonious explanation. By respecifying a smaller number of components, we lose some information. That is, the retained components (now 4) cannot explain all of the variance present in the data (as we saw, it explains about 39%, cumulatively). The amount of variance explained in each variable is represented by the communalities after extraction. We can examine the communalities through the lens of Kaiser’s criterion (the eigenvalue &gt; 1 criteria) to see if we think that “four” was a good number of components to extract. Kaiser’s criterion is believed to be accurate if: when there are fewer than 30 variables (we had 25) and, after extraction, the communalities are greater than .70 looking at our data, none are &gt; .70, so, this does not support extracting four components when the sample size is greater than 250 (ours was 259) and the average communality is &gt; .60 we can extract the communalities from our object and calculate the mean the average communality Using the names() function again, we see that “communality” is available. Thus, we can easily calculate their mean. To get this value let’s first examine the possible contents of the object we created from this PCA analysis by asking for its names. names(pca2) [1] &quot;values&quot; &quot;rotation&quot; &quot;n.obs&quot; &quot;communality&quot; &quot;loadings&quot; [6] &quot;fit&quot; &quot;fit.off&quot; &quot;fn&quot; &quot;Call&quot; &quot;uniquenesses&quot; [11] &quot;complexity&quot; &quot;valid&quot; &quot;chi&quot; &quot;EPVAL&quot; &quot;R2&quot; [16] &quot;objective&quot; &quot;residual&quot; &quot;rms&quot; &quot;factors&quot; &quot;dof&quot; [21] &quot;null.dof&quot; &quot;null.model&quot; &quot;criteria&quot; &quot;STATISTIC&quot; &quot;PVAL&quot; [26] &quot;weights&quot; &quot;r.scores&quot; &quot;Vaccounted&quot; &quot;Structure&quot; &quot;scores&quot; We see that it includes communalities. Thus, we can easily calculate their mean. mean(pca2$communality) [1] 0.3932201 We see that the average communality is 0.39. These two criteria would suggest that we may not have the best solution. That said (in our defense): We used the scree plot as a guide and there was support for four dimensions. We have an adequate sample size and that was supported with the KMO. Are the number of components consistent with theory? We have not yet inspected the component loadings. This will provide us with more information. We could do several things: re-run with a different number of components (recall Lewis and Neville (2015) ran models with 2, 3, 4, and 5 factors) conduct more diagnostics reproduced correlation matrix the difference between the reproduced correlation matrix and the correlation matrix in the data The factor.model() function in psych produces the reproduced correlation matrix by using the loadings from our extracted object. Conceptually, this matrix is the correlations that should be produced if we did not have the raw data but we only had the component loadings. We could do fancy matrix algebra and produce these. The questions, though, is: How close did we get? How different is the reproduced correlation matrix from GRMSmatrix – the \\(R\\)-matrix produced from our raw data. # produces the reproduced correlation matrix round(psych::factor.model(pca2$loadings), 3) Obj1 Obj2 Obj3 Obj4 Obj5 Obj6 Obj7 Obj8 Obj9 Obj10 Marg1 Obj1 0.368 0.375 0.343 0.372 0.346 0.308 0.324 0.340 0.298 0.329 0.171 Obj2 0.375 0.387 0.350 0.388 0.352 0.313 0.341 0.358 0.297 0.335 0.217 Obj3 0.343 0.350 0.321 0.346 0.326 0.281 0.305 0.320 0.280 0.303 0.169 Obj4 0.372 0.388 0.346 0.404 0.356 0.291 0.333 0.397 0.292 0.335 0.224 Obj5 0.346 0.352 0.326 0.356 0.365 0.208 0.303 0.377 0.305 0.277 0.205 Obj6 0.308 0.313 0.281 0.291 0.208 0.424 0.274 0.157 0.202 0.338 0.044 Obj7 0.324 0.341 0.305 0.333 0.303 0.274 0.325 0.298 0.247 0.280 0.285 Obj8 0.340 0.358 0.320 0.397 0.377 0.157 0.298 0.469 0.294 0.273 0.264 Obj9 0.298 0.297 0.280 0.292 0.305 0.202 0.247 0.294 0.268 0.247 0.101 Obj10 0.329 0.335 0.303 0.335 0.277 0.338 0.280 0.273 0.247 0.326 0.085 Marg1 0.171 0.217 0.169 0.224 0.205 0.044 0.285 0.264 0.101 0.085 0.633 Marg2 0.177 0.207 0.175 0.179 0.195 0.093 0.276 0.170 0.122 0.092 0.519 Marg3 0.171 0.203 0.169 0.201 0.206 0.047 0.250 0.234 0.124 0.088 0.493 Marg4 0.203 0.242 0.194 0.256 0.199 0.143 0.272 0.259 0.118 0.159 0.465 Marg5 0.211 0.244 0.205 0.242 0.238 0.090 0.284 0.268 0.152 0.129 0.505 Marg6 0.277 0.305 0.261 0.304 0.255 0.238 0.310 0.275 0.189 0.238 0.368 Marg7 0.130 0.163 0.127 0.165 0.133 0.081 0.207 0.166 0.068 0.086 0.418 Str1 0.189 0.180 0.188 0.133 0.260 0.009 0.191 0.172 0.225 0.070 0.203 Str2 0.229 0.222 0.216 0.174 0.204 0.227 0.218 0.103 0.197 0.189 0.095 Str3 0.130 0.113 0.131 0.044 0.162 0.052 0.135 0.020 0.162 0.045 0.088 Str4 0.150 0.132 0.148 0.089 0.207 0.006 0.125 0.119 0.194 0.057 0.061 Str5 0.148 0.140 0.144 0.078 0.136 0.148 0.162 0.010 0.138 0.100 0.101 Ang1 0.088 0.089 0.089 0.020 0.068 0.123 0.148 -0.065 0.066 0.045 0.197 Ang2 0.101 0.119 0.092 0.065 -0.017 0.321 0.180 -0.119 -0.009 0.145 0.196 Ang3 0.138 0.154 0.129 0.107 0.059 0.265 0.205 -0.027 0.050 0.145 0.238 Marg2 Marg3 Marg4 Marg5 Marg6 Marg7 Str1 Str2 Str3 Str4 Str5 Obj1 0.177 0.171 0.203 0.211 0.277 0.130 0.189 0.229 0.130 0.150 0.148 Obj2 0.207 0.203 0.242 0.244 0.305 0.163 0.180 0.222 0.113 0.132 0.140 Obj3 0.175 0.169 0.194 0.205 0.261 0.127 0.188 0.216 0.131 0.148 0.144 Obj4 0.179 0.201 0.256 0.242 0.304 0.165 0.133 0.174 0.044 0.089 0.078 Obj5 0.195 0.206 0.199 0.238 0.255 0.133 0.260 0.204 0.162 0.207 0.136 Obj6 0.093 0.047 0.143 0.090 0.238 0.081 0.009 0.227 0.052 0.006 0.148 Obj7 0.276 0.250 0.272 0.284 0.310 0.207 0.191 0.218 0.135 0.125 0.162 Obj8 0.170 0.234 0.259 0.268 0.275 0.166 0.172 0.103 0.020 0.119 0.010 Obj9 0.122 0.124 0.118 0.152 0.189 0.068 0.225 0.197 0.162 0.194 0.138 Obj10 0.092 0.088 0.159 0.129 0.238 0.086 0.070 0.189 0.045 0.057 0.100 Marg1 0.519 0.493 0.465 0.505 0.368 0.418 0.203 0.095 0.088 0.061 0.101 Marg2 0.501 0.426 0.365 0.437 0.321 0.347 0.295 0.198 0.237 0.165 0.226 Marg3 0.426 0.398 0.356 0.409 0.298 0.321 0.234 0.122 0.139 0.118 0.128 Marg4 0.365 0.356 0.386 0.378 0.331 0.323 0.085 0.084 0.001 -0.011 0.052 Marg5 0.437 0.409 0.378 0.425 0.328 0.334 0.237 0.142 0.139 0.119 0.136 Marg6 0.321 0.298 0.331 0.328 0.329 0.265 0.132 0.166 0.072 0.054 0.119 Marg7 0.347 0.321 0.323 0.334 0.265 0.286 0.103 0.076 0.043 0.012 0.074 Str1 0.295 0.234 0.085 0.237 0.132 0.103 0.495 0.269 0.435 0.413 0.303 Str2 0.198 0.122 0.084 0.142 0.166 0.076 0.269 0.276 0.289 0.229 0.269 Str3 0.237 0.139 0.001 0.139 0.072 0.043 0.435 0.289 0.449 0.377 0.341 Str4 0.165 0.118 -0.011 0.119 0.054 0.012 0.413 0.229 0.377 0.366 0.255 Str5 0.226 0.128 0.052 0.136 0.119 0.074 0.303 0.269 0.341 0.255 0.298 Ang1 0.311 0.188 0.110 0.191 0.141 0.143 0.277 0.253 0.333 0.208 0.309 Ang2 0.262 0.138 0.198 0.157 0.219 0.192 -0.034 0.195 0.085 -0.074 0.205 Ang3 0.293 0.187 0.211 0.206 0.230 0.201 0.073 0.207 0.143 0.016 0.216 Ang1 Ang2 Ang3 Obj1 0.088 0.101 0.138 Obj2 0.089 0.119 0.154 Obj3 0.089 0.092 0.129 Obj4 0.020 0.065 0.107 Obj5 0.068 -0.017 0.059 Obj6 0.123 0.321 0.265 Obj7 0.148 0.180 0.205 Obj8 -0.065 -0.119 -0.027 Obj9 0.066 -0.009 0.050 Obj10 0.045 0.145 0.145 Marg1 0.197 0.196 0.238 Marg2 0.311 0.262 0.293 Marg3 0.188 0.138 0.187 Marg4 0.110 0.198 0.211 Marg5 0.191 0.157 0.206 Marg6 0.141 0.219 0.230 Marg7 0.143 0.192 0.201 Str1 0.277 -0.034 0.073 Str2 0.253 0.195 0.207 Str3 0.333 0.085 0.143 Str4 0.208 -0.074 0.016 Str5 0.309 0.205 0.216 Ang1 0.372 0.312 0.299 Ang2 0.312 0.575 0.454 Ang3 0.299 0.454 0.383 We’re not really interested in this matrix. We just need it to compare it to the GRMSmatrix to produce the residuals. We do that next. Residuals are the difference between the reproduced (i.e., those created from our component loadings) and \\(R\\)-matrix produced by the raw data. If we look at the \\(r_{_{Obj1Obj2}}\\) in our original correlation matrix (theoretically from the raw data [although we simulated data]), the value is 0.35 The reproduced correlation that we just calculated for this pair is 0.375. The diffference is -0.025. 0.35 - 0.375 [1] -0.025 By using the factor.residuals() function R will calculate the residuals for each pair. round(psych::factor.residuals(GRMSmatrix, pca2$loadings), 3) Obj1 Obj2 Obj3 Obj4 Obj5 Obj6 Obj7 Obj8 Obj9 Obj10 Obj1 0.632 -0.020 -0.093 -0.101 -0.063 -0.057 -0.044 0.006 -0.145 -0.088 Obj2 -0.020 0.613 -0.038 -0.140 -0.085 -0.079 -0.029 -0.076 -0.035 -0.090 Obj3 -0.093 -0.038 0.679 -0.105 -0.043 -0.002 -0.103 -0.072 -0.070 -0.088 Obj4 -0.101 -0.140 -0.105 0.596 0.031 -0.060 -0.048 -0.100 -0.036 -0.055 Obj5 -0.063 -0.085 -0.043 0.031 0.635 -0.055 -0.126 -0.086 -0.053 -0.072 Obj6 -0.057 -0.079 -0.002 -0.060 -0.055 0.576 -0.075 -0.015 0.004 -0.217 Obj7 -0.044 -0.029 -0.103 -0.048 -0.126 -0.075 0.675 0.009 -0.054 0.004 Obj8 0.006 -0.076 -0.072 -0.100 -0.086 -0.015 0.009 0.531 -0.101 -0.043 Obj9 -0.145 -0.035 -0.070 -0.036 -0.053 0.004 -0.054 -0.101 0.732 -0.049 Obj10 -0.088 -0.090 -0.088 -0.055 -0.072 -0.217 0.004 -0.043 -0.049 0.674 Marg1 0.014 -0.002 0.000 -0.005 -0.039 0.058 0.011 0.004 0.000 0.009 Marg2 0.068 0.000 0.055 -0.002 0.002 0.045 -0.061 -0.034 -0.004 0.031 Marg3 -0.002 0.042 0.005 -0.064 0.020 0.005 -0.052 -0.095 0.091 0.077 Marg4 -0.015 -0.061 0.048 0.000 -0.002 -0.041 -0.021 -0.020 -0.051 -0.038 Marg5 -0.039 -0.025 0.007 0.026 0.014 0.072 -0.053 -0.081 0.037 -0.020 Marg6 -0.099 -0.036 -0.102 -0.076 -0.030 0.024 -0.025 -0.014 -0.039 0.018 Marg7 -0.001 0.028 0.015 0.029 -0.076 0.093 -0.052 -0.025 0.037 0.023 Str1 0.026 0.005 -0.046 -0.071 -0.029 0.057 0.056 -0.006 -0.034 0.031 Str2 -0.041 -0.038 -0.027 0.016 -0.088 -0.075 -0.083 -0.040 -0.014 -0.002 Str3 -0.033 -0.025 -0.040 0.036 -0.052 0.042 0.052 0.026 -0.046 0.053 Str4 -0.056 0.008 0.036 0.061 -0.087 0.077 -0.055 0.009 -0.141 -0.034 Str5 0.049 0.006 0.009 0.002 0.054 -0.035 -0.013 0.027 -0.072 -0.009 Ang1 -0.025 -0.021 -0.016 0.072 0.050 -0.083 0.003 0.138 0.103 0.018 Ang2 -0.043 0.026 -0.009 -0.005 0.104 -0.124 -0.050 0.093 0.005 -0.007 Ang3 0.068 -0.027 -0.017 0.033 0.046 -0.110 0.021 0.092 0.012 -0.062 Marg1 Marg2 Marg3 Marg4 Marg5 Marg6 Marg7 Str1 Str2 Str3 Obj1 0.014 0.068 -0.002 -0.015 -0.039 -0.099 -0.001 0.026 -0.041 -0.033 Obj2 -0.002 0.000 0.042 -0.061 -0.025 -0.036 0.028 0.005 -0.038 -0.025 Obj3 0.000 0.055 0.005 0.048 0.007 -0.102 0.015 -0.046 -0.027 -0.040 Obj4 -0.005 -0.002 -0.064 0.000 0.026 -0.076 0.029 -0.071 0.016 0.036 Obj5 -0.039 0.002 0.020 -0.002 0.014 -0.030 -0.076 -0.029 -0.088 -0.052 Obj6 0.058 0.045 0.005 -0.041 0.072 0.024 0.093 0.057 -0.075 0.042 Obj7 0.011 -0.061 -0.052 -0.021 -0.053 -0.025 -0.052 0.056 -0.083 0.052 Obj8 0.004 -0.034 -0.095 -0.020 -0.081 -0.014 -0.025 -0.006 -0.040 0.026 Obj9 0.000 -0.004 0.091 -0.051 0.037 -0.039 0.037 -0.034 -0.014 -0.046 Obj10 0.009 0.031 0.077 -0.038 -0.020 0.018 0.023 0.031 -0.002 0.053 Marg1 0.367 -0.094 -0.086 -0.089 -0.098 -0.020 -0.110 -0.012 0.026 0.043 Marg2 -0.094 0.499 -0.078 -0.134 -0.034 -0.053 -0.022 -0.041 -0.016 -0.057 Marg3 -0.086 -0.078 0.602 -0.033 -0.158 -0.044 -0.117 -0.031 0.051 -0.043 Marg4 -0.089 -0.134 -0.033 0.614 -0.079 -0.073 -0.159 0.015 0.128 0.048 Marg5 -0.098 -0.034 -0.158 -0.079 0.575 -0.038 -0.052 -0.079 -0.009 0.019 Marg6 -0.020 -0.053 -0.044 -0.073 -0.038 0.671 -0.066 -0.003 0.018 0.075 Marg7 -0.110 -0.022 -0.117 -0.159 -0.052 -0.066 0.714 0.037 -0.024 -0.002 Str1 -0.012 -0.041 -0.031 0.015 -0.079 -0.003 0.037 0.505 -0.054 -0.133 Str2 0.026 -0.016 0.051 0.128 -0.009 0.018 -0.024 -0.054 0.724 -0.091 Str3 0.043 -0.057 -0.043 0.048 0.019 0.075 -0.002 -0.133 -0.091 0.551 Str4 0.023 -0.048 -0.039 0.073 0.021 0.080 0.005 -0.187 -0.026 -0.109 Str5 -0.001 0.003 -0.005 -0.020 0.040 -0.035 0.049 -0.073 -0.148 -0.161 Ang1 -0.034 -0.079 -0.006 0.008 -0.076 -0.036 0.028 -0.096 -0.093 -0.134 Ang2 -0.026 -0.077 0.054 0.024 -0.015 -0.006 -0.059 0.084 -0.074 -0.011 Ang3 0.041 -0.015 -0.077 -0.038 0.003 -0.114 -0.115 0.029 -0.052 0.004 Str4 Str5 Ang1 Ang2 Ang3 Obj1 -0.056 0.049 -0.025 -0.043 0.068 Obj2 0.008 0.006 -0.021 0.026 -0.027 Obj3 0.036 0.009 -0.016 -0.009 -0.017 Obj4 0.061 0.002 0.072 -0.005 0.033 Obj5 -0.087 0.054 0.050 0.104 0.046 Obj6 0.077 -0.035 -0.083 -0.124 -0.110 Obj7 -0.055 -0.013 0.003 -0.050 0.021 Obj8 0.009 0.027 0.138 0.093 0.092 Obj9 -0.141 -0.072 0.103 0.005 0.012 Obj10 -0.034 -0.009 0.018 -0.007 -0.062 Marg1 0.023 -0.001 -0.034 -0.026 0.041 Marg2 -0.048 0.003 -0.079 -0.077 -0.015 Marg3 -0.039 -0.005 -0.006 0.054 -0.077 Marg4 0.073 -0.020 0.008 0.024 -0.038 Marg5 0.021 0.040 -0.076 -0.015 0.003 Marg6 0.080 -0.035 -0.036 -0.006 -0.114 Marg7 0.005 0.049 0.028 -0.059 -0.115 Str1 -0.187 -0.073 -0.096 0.084 0.029 Str2 -0.026 -0.148 -0.093 -0.074 -0.052 Str3 -0.109 -0.161 -0.134 -0.011 0.004 Str4 0.634 -0.136 -0.054 0.105 0.006 Str5 -0.136 0.702 -0.085 -0.051 -0.110 Ang1 -0.054 -0.085 0.628 -0.072 -0.067 Ang2 0.105 -0.051 -0.072 0.425 -0.204 Ang3 0.006 -0.110 -0.067 -0.204 0.617 Their calculated difference (-0.20) is quite close to our hand calculation (-0.25). There are several strategies to evaluate this matrix: See how large the residuals are compared to the original correlations. The worst possible model would occur if we extracted no components and would be the size of the original correlations. If the correlations were small to start with, we expect small residuals. If the correlations were large to start with, the residuals will be relatively larger (this is not terribly problematic). Comparing residuals requires squaring them first (because residuals can be both positive and negative). The sum of the squared residuals divided by the sum of the squared correlations is an estimate of model fit.Subtracting this from 1.0 means that it ranges from 0 to 1. Values &gt; .95 are an indication of good fit. Analyzing the residuals means we need to extract only the upper right of the triangle of the matrix into an object. We can do this in steps. # first extract the residuals pca2_resids &lt;- psych::factor.residuals(GRMSmatrix, pca2$loadings) # the object has the residuals in a single column pca2_resids &lt;- as.matrix(pca2_resids[upper.tri(pca2_resids)]) # display the first 6 rows of the residuals head(pca2_resids) [,1] [1,] -0.02024211 [2,] -0.09293107 [3,] -0.03803285 [4,] -0.10123779 [5,] -0.14040791 [6,] -0.10510587 One criteria of residual analysis is to see how many residuals there are that are greater than an absolute value of 0.05. The result will be a single column with TRUE if it is &gt; |0.05| and false if it is smaller. The sum function will tell us how many TRUE responses are in the matrix. Further, we can write script to obtain the proportion of total number of residuals. large.resid &lt;- abs(pca2_resids) &gt; 0.05 # large.resid sum(large.resid) [1] 129 round(sum(large.resid)/nrow(pca2_resids), 3) [1] 0.43 We learn that there are 129 residuals greater than the absolute value of 0.05. This represents 43% of the total number of residuals. There are no hard rules about what proportion of residuals can be greater than 0.05. A common practice is to stay below 50% (Field, 2012). Another approach to analyzing residuals is to look at their mean. Because of the +/- valences, we need to square them (to eliminate the negative), take the average, then take the square root. round(sqrt(mean(pca2_resids^2)), 3) [1] 0.064 While there are no clear guidelines to interpret these, one recommendation is to consider extracting more components if the value is higher than 0.08 (Field, 2012). Our value of 0.064 is &lt; 0.08. Finally, we expect our residuals to be normally distributed. A histogram can help us inspect the distribution. hist(pca2_resids) This looks reasonably normal to me and I do not see an indication of outliers. 8.5.3.1 Quick recap of how to evaluate the # of components we extracted If fewer than 30 variables, the eigenvalue &gt; 1 (Kaiser’s) critera is fine, so long as communalities are all &gt; .70. If sample size &gt; 250 and the average communalities are .6 or greater, this is acceptable. When N &gt; 200, the scree plot can be used. Regarding residuals: Fewer than 50% should have absolute values &gt; 0.05. Model fit should be &gt; 0.90. 8.5.4 Component Rotation Below is a snip from the workflow to remind us where we are in the steps to PCA. Image of an excerpt from the workflow Rotation improves the interpretation of the components by maximizing the loading on each variable on one of the extracted components while minimizing the loading on all other components. Rotation works by changing the absolute values of the variables while keeping their differential values constant. There are two big choices and we need to make them on theoretical grounds: Orthogonal rotation if you think that the components are independent/unrelated. Varimax is the most common orthogonal rotation. Oblique rotation if you think that the components are related correlated. Oblimin and promax are common oblique rotations. Which to do? Orthogonal is sometimes considered to be “easier” because it minimizes cross-loadings, but Can you think of a measure where the subscales would not be correlated? 8.5.4.1 Orthogonal rotation # pcaORTH &lt;- psych::principal(GRMSmatrix, nfactors = 4, rotate = # &#39;varimax&#39;) pcaORTH &lt;- psych::principal(dfGRMS, nfactors = 4, rotate = &quot;varimax&quot;) pcaORTH Principal Components Analysis Call: psych::principal(r = dfGRMS, nfactors = 4, rotate = &quot;varimax&quot;) Standardized loadings (pattern matrix) based upon correlation matrix RC1 RC2 RC3 RC4 h2 u2 com Obj1 0.57 0.12 0.13 0.08 0.37 0.63 1.2 Obj2 0.58 0.18 0.10 0.09 0.39 0.61 1.3 Obj3 0.53 0.13 0.14 0.07 0.32 0.68 1.3 Obj4 0.60 0.20 0.00 0.01 0.40 0.60 1.2 Obj5 0.53 0.18 0.20 -0.10 0.36 0.64 1.6 Obj6 0.49 -0.04 -0.02 0.43 0.42 0.58 2.0 Obj7 0.46 0.28 0.13 0.15 0.32 0.68 2.1 Obj8 0.57 0.27 0.00 -0.26 0.47 0.53 1.9 Obj9 0.47 0.05 0.21 -0.05 0.27 0.73 1.4 Obj10 0.54 0.02 0.00 0.17 0.33 0.67 1.2 Marg1 0.11 0.78 0.06 0.05 0.63 0.37 1.1 Marg2 0.09 0.61 0.28 0.18 0.50 0.50 1.7 Marg3 0.13 0.60 0.16 0.02 0.40 0.60 1.2 Marg4 0.24 0.56 -0.07 0.11 0.39 0.61 1.5 Marg5 0.20 0.60 0.15 0.04 0.43 0.57 1.4 Marg6 0.37 0.40 0.03 0.18 0.33 0.67 2.4 Marg7 0.10 0.51 0.00 0.12 0.29 0.71 1.2 Str1 0.16 0.19 0.65 -0.12 0.50 0.50 1.4 Str2 0.27 0.04 0.38 0.24 0.28 0.72 2.6 Str3 0.05 0.05 0.66 0.09 0.45 0.55 1.1 Str4 0.14 0.02 0.57 -0.12 0.37 0.63 1.2 Str5 0.10 0.06 0.47 0.25 0.30 0.70 1.7 Ang1 -0.04 0.20 0.44 0.37 0.37 0.63 2.4 Ang2 0.03 0.19 0.01 0.73 0.57 0.43 1.1 Ang3 0.09 0.25 0.12 0.55 0.38 0.62 1.5 RC1 RC2 RC3 RC4 SS loadings 3.31 2.92 2.05 1.56 Proportion Var 0.13 0.12 0.08 0.06 Cumulative Var 0.13 0.25 0.33 0.39 Proportion Explained 0.34 0.30 0.21 0.16 Cumulative Proportion 0.34 0.63 0.84 1.00 Mean item complexity = 1.5 Test of the hypothesis that 4 components are sufficient.

Our communality and uniqueness values remain the same. The eigenvalues (SS loadings) should even out, but the proportion of variance explained and cumulative variance will remain the same (39%). The print.psych() function facilitates interpretation and prioritizes the information about which we care most: “cut” will display loadings above .3 if some items load on no factors if some items have cross-loadings (and their relative weights) “sort” will reorder the loadings to make it clearer (to the best of its ability…in the case of ties) to which component/scale it belongs pca_table &lt;- psych::print.psych(pcaORTH, cut = 0.3, sort = TRUE) Principal Components Analysis Call: psych::principal(r = dfGRMS, nfactors = 4, rotate = &quot;varimax&quot;) Standardized loadings (pattern matrix) based upon correlation matrix item RC1 RC2 RC3 RC4 h2 u2 com Obj4 4 0.60 0.40 0.60 1.2 Obj2 2 0.58 0.39 0.61 1.3 Obj1 1 0.57 0.37 0.63 1.2 Obj8 8 0.57 0.47 0.53 1.9 Obj10 10 0.54 0.33 0.67 1.2 Obj5 5 0.53 0.36 0.64 1.6 Obj3 3 0.53 0.32 0.68 1.3 Obj6 6 0.49 0.43 0.42 0.58 2.0 Obj9 9 0.47 0.27 0.73 1.4 Obj7 7 0.46 0.32 0.68 2.1 Marg1 11 0.78 0.63 0.37 1.1 Marg2 12 0.61 0.50 0.50 1.7 Marg5 15 0.60 0.43 0.57 1.4 Marg3 13 0.60 0.40 0.60 1.2 Marg4 14 0.56 0.39 0.61 1.5 Marg7 17 0.51 0.29 0.71 1.2 Marg6 16 0.37 0.40 0.33 0.67 2.4 Str3 20 0.66 0.45 0.55 1.1 Str1 18 0.65 0.50 0.50 1.4 Str4 21 0.57 0.37 0.63 1.2 Str5 22 0.47 0.30 0.70 1.7 Ang1 23 0.44 0.37 0.37 0.63 2.4 Str2 19 0.38 0.28 0.72 2.6 Ang2 24 0.73 0.57 0.43 1.1 Ang3 25 0.55 0.38 0.62 1.5 RC1 RC2 RC3 RC4 SS loadings 3.31 2.92 2.05 1.56 Proportion Var 0.13 0.12 0.08 0.06 Cumulative Var 0.13 0.25 0.33 0.39 Proportion Explained 0.34 0.30 0.21 0.16 Cumulative Proportion 0.34 0.63 0.84 1.00 Mean item complexity = 1.5 Test of the hypothesis that 4 components are sufficient.

After rotation, there are four clear components/scales. Further, there is clear (or at least reasonable) component/scale membership for each item. This table lists all factor loadings that are greater than 0.30. When an item has multiple factor loadings listed, we inspect it for “cross-loading.” We observe cross-loadings with the following items: Obj6, Marg6, Ang1. If this were a new scale and we had not yet established ideas for subscales, the next step would be to examine the items, themselves, and try to name the scales/components. If our scale construction included a priori/planned subscales, this is where we hope that the items fall where they were hypothesized to do so.

The oblique rotation allows us to see the correlation between the components/scales. This was not available in the orthogonal rotation because the assumption of the orthogonal/varimax rotation is that the scales/components are uncorrelated; hence in the analysis they were fixed to 0.0. We can see that all the scales have low to moderate (i.e, 0.09 to 0.35) correlations with each other. Of course, there is always a little complexity. In oblique rotations, there is a distinction between the pattern matrix (which reports component loadings and is comparable to the matrix we interpreted for the orthogonal rotation) and the structure matrix (takes into account the relationship between the components/scales – it is a product of the pattern matrix and the matrix containing the correlation coefficients between the components/scales). Most interpret the pattern matrix because it is simpler; however, it could be that values in the pattern matrix are suppressed because of relations between the components. Therefore, the structure matrix can be a useful check and some editors will request it. Obtaining the structure matrix requires two steps. First, we multiply the factor loadings with the phi matrix. # names(pcaOBL) pcaOBL$loadings %*% pcaOBL$Phi TC2 TC1 TC3 TC4 Obj1 0.59854109 0.2370854 0.21076193 0.10026056 Obj2 0.61370763 0.2936877 0.18613777 0.11300577 Obj3 0.55625886 0.2340806 0.21133177 0.08838322 Obj4 0.62653372 0.2994708 0.09212284 0.03271529 Obj5 0.55782211 0.2813705 0.27627677 -0.06671857 Obj6 0.50436458 0.0686600 0.04959170 0.42362055 Obj7 0.51583784 0.3746086 0.21323217 0.18475919 Obj8 0.58631883 0.3483430 0.08569629 -0.22925474 Obj9 0.47739175 0.1500764 0.26407686 -0.03124475 Obj10 0.55033661 0.1232499 0.06974955 0.17330360 Marg1 0.25202377 0.7945638 0.16105543 0.13171661 Marg2 0.22669221 0.6607073 0.36285145 0.25811600 Marg3 0.24653097 0.6246027 0.23339896 0.08632620 Marg4 0.33257030 0.5843225 0.01980084 0.16383648 Marg5 0.31382840 0.6413860 0.23355689 0.10932345 Marg6 0.44535049 0.4708617 0.11768477 0.21681782 Marg7 0.19733852 0.5242792 0.07531732 0.17048225 Str1 0.22295271 0.2846102 0.67447904 -0.06303143 Str2 0.31665124 0.1416729 0.41881452 0.26069989 Str3 0.11375939 0.1383416 0.66583221 0.12771942 Str4 0.17266253 0.1046982 0.58122385 -0.09110045 Str5 0.16426964 0.1477531 0.49084330 0.27949111 Ang1 0.05479887 0.2604643 0.46720892 0.40679247 Ang2 0.12294975 0.2431195 0.06259901 0.74708242 Ang3 0.17778840 0.3025083 0.17023961 0.57585722 Next, we can use Field’s (2012) function to produce the matrix. # Field&#39;s function to produce the structure matrix factor.structure &lt;- function(fa, cut = 0.2, decimals = 2) { structure.matrix &lt;- psych::fa.sort(fa$loadings %*% fa$Phi) structure.matrix &lt;- data.frame(ifelse(abs(structure.matrix) &lt; cut, &quot;&quot;, round(structure.matrix, decimals))) return(structure.matrix) } factor.structure(pcaOBL, cut = 0.3) TC2 TC1 TC3 TC4 Obj4 0.63 Obj2 0.61 Obj1 0.6 Obj8 0.59 0.35 Obj5 0.56 Obj3 0.56 Obj10 0.55 Obj7 0.52 0.37 Obj6 0.5 0.42 Obj9 0.48 Marg1 0.79 Marg2 0.66 0.36 Marg5 0.31 0.64 Marg3 0.62 Marg4 0.33 0.58 Marg7 0.52 Marg6 0.45 0.47 Str1 0.67 Str3 0.67 Str4 0.58 Str5 0.49 Ang1 0.47 0.41 Str2 0.32 0.42 Ang2 0.75 Ang3 0.3 0.58 Although some of the relative values changed, our items were stable regarding their component membership. 8.5.5 Component Scores Component scores (PC scores) can be created for each case (row) on each component (column). These can be used to assess the relative standing of one person on the construct/variable to another. We can also use them in regression (in place of means or sums) when groups of predictors correlate so highly that there is multicollinearity.

Data screening were conducted to determine the suitability of the data for this analyses. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy (KMO; Kaiser, 1970) represents the ratio of the squared correlation between variables to the squared partial correlation between variables. KMO ranges from 0.00 to 1.00; values closer to 1.00 indicate that the patterns of correlations are relatively compact and that component analysis should yield distinct and reliable components (Field, 2012). In our dataset, the KMO value was .85, indicating acceptable sampling adequacy. The Barlett’s Test of Sphericity examines whether the population correlation matrix resembles an identity matrix (Field, 2012). When the p value for the Bartlett’s test is &lt; .05, we are fairly certain we have clusters of correlated variables. In our dataset, \\(\\chi^{2}(300)=1217.508, p &lt; .001\\), indicating the correlations between items are sufficiently large enough for principal components analysis. The determinant of the correlation matrix alerts us to any issues of multicollinearity or singularity and should be larger than 0.00001. Our determinant was 0.0075, supporting the suitability of our data for analysis. Four criteria were used to determine the number of components to extract: a priori theory, the scree test, the eigenvalue-greater-than-one criteria, and the interpretability of the solution. Kaiser’s eigenvalue-greater-than-one criteria suggested seven components, and, in combination explained 39% of the variance. The inflexion in the scree plot suggested retaining between one and four components. Considering the a priori theory obtained from the original psychometric article (J. A. Lewis &amp; Neville, 2015), four components were extracted. We investigated each with orthogonal (varimax) and oblique (oblimin) procedures. Given the low-to-moderate correlations (ranging from 0.09 to 0.35) and the clear component loadings, we determined that an oblique solution was most appropriate. The rotated solution, as shown in Table 1 and Figure 1, yielded four interpretable components, each listed with the proportion of variance accounted for: assumptions of beauty and sexual objectification (13%), silenced and marginalized (12%), strong woman stereotype (8%), and angry woman stereotype (6%). Regarding the Table 1, I would include a table with all the values, bolding those with component membership. This is easy, though, because it is how the table was exported when we wrote it to a .csv file. 8.7 Back to the FutuRe: The relationship between PCA and item analysis Earlier in the ReCentering Psych Stats OER I included the lesson on item analysis because I find it to be a useful stepping stone into principal components and principal factor analyses. Nearing the end of the lesson on PCA, we can ask, “How do the results we obtained from PCA compare to those found in item analysis?” To answer these questions we will (a) calculate corrected item-total correlation coefficients, (c) calculate correlations between each item and the mean scores from the remaining scales, (c) calculate component loadings for a PCA with an orthogonal rotation, and (d) calculate component loadings for a PCA with an oblique rotation. I will teach the last step – assembling them into a single table – in R. The code is complicated and many might choose to do it in a spreadsheet, outside of the R environment. After assembly, though, we can compare the results. First, we score the total and subscales using the dataset we simulated above (dfGRMS). library(tidyverse) GRMSVars &lt;- c(&quot;Obj1&quot;, &quot;Obj2&quot;, &quot;Obj3&quot;, &quot;Obj4&quot;, &quot;Obj5&quot;, &quot;Obj6&quot;, &quot;Obj7&quot;, &quot;Obj8&quot;, &quot;Obj9&quot;, &quot;Obj10&quot;, &quot;Marg1&quot;, &quot;Marg2&quot;, &quot;Marg3&quot;, &quot;Marg4&quot;, &quot;Marg5&quot;, &quot;Marg6&quot;, &quot;Marg7&quot;, &quot;Str1&quot;, &quot;Str2&quot;, &quot;Str3&quot;, &quot;Str4&quot;, &quot;Str5&quot;, &quot;Ang1&quot;, &quot;Ang2&quot;, &quot;Ang3&quot;) ObjectifiedVars &lt;- c(&quot;Obj1&quot;, &quot;Obj2&quot;, &quot;Obj3&quot;, &quot;Obj4&quot;, &quot;Obj5&quot;, &quot;Obj6&quot;, &quot;Obj7&quot;, &quot;Obj8&quot;, &quot;Obj9&quot;, &quot;Obj10&quot;) MarginalizedVars &lt;- c(&quot;Marg1&quot;, &quot;Marg2&quot;, &quot;Marg3&quot;, &quot;Marg4&quot;, &quot;Marg5&quot;, &quot;Marg6&quot;, &quot;Marg7&quot;) StrongVars &lt;- c(&quot;Str1&quot;, &quot;Str2&quot;, &quot;Str3&quot;, &quot;Str4&quot;, &quot;Str5&quot;) AngryVars &lt;- c(&quot;Ang1&quot;, &quot;Ang2&quot;, &quot;Ang3&quot;) dfGRMS$GRMStot &lt;- sjstats::mean_n(dfGRMS[, GRMSVars], 0.8) #will create the mean for each individual if 80% of variables are present dfGRMS$Objectified &lt;- sjstats::mean_n(dfGRMS[, ObjectifiedVars], 0.8) #will create the mean for each individual if 80% of variables are present dfGRMS$Marginalized &lt;- sjstats::mean_n(dfGRMS[, MarginalizedVars], 0.8) #will create the mean for each individual if 80% of variables are present dfGRMS$Strong &lt;- sjstats::mean_n(dfGRMS[, StrongVars], 0.8) #will create the mean for each individual if 80% of variables are present (in this case all variables must be present) dfGRMS$Angry &lt;- sjstats::mean_n(dfGRMS[, AngryVars], 0.8) #will create the mean for each individual if 80% of variables are present (in this case all variables must be present) While we are at it, let’s just create tiny dfs with just our variables of interest.

correlation does not include the item being correlated) and the other subscales PCA: Orthogonal rotation factor loadings of the four-scales with a rotation that maximizes the independents (uncorrelatedness) of the scales PCA: Oblique rotation factor loadings of the four-scales with a rotation that permits correlation between subscales Image of a table of values from the item analysis and PCA solutions with orthogonal and oblique rotations We expect to see similar results across the item-analysis, PCA orthogonal, and PCA oblique solutions. Our biggest interest is in whether items change scale membership and/or have cross-loadings. Overall, we are looking for items that load higher on their own scales than they do on other scales. When there are a number of cross-loadings, it means that the item will not discriminate well (think within-in scale discriminant validity). If there are a number of cross-loadings, there will likely be stronger correlations between subscales (indicating that an oblique rotation is/was an appropriate choice). Low/no cross-loadings, supports the choices of an orthogonal (uncorrelated) solution. Within-scale convergent validity is supported when an item has a strong, positive loading on its own scale and low/zero loadings on the other scales.. Our simulation from the Lewis and Neville’s (2015) GRMS produced slightly different results from their original data. Specifically, our “Angry1” item cross-loaded on both the Strong Angry subscales with slightly stronger loadings on the Strong (incorrect) subscale.The items behaved much better in the original article. 8.8 Practice Problems In each of these lessons I provide suggestions for practice that allow you to select one or more problems that are graded in difficulty. In psychometrics, I strongly recommend that you have started with a dataset that has a minimum of three subscales and use it for all of the assignments in the OER. In any case, please plan to: Properly format and prepare the data. Conduct diagnostic tests to determine the suitability of the data for PCA. Conduct tests to guide the decisions about number of components to extract. Conduct orthogonal and oblique rotations (at least two each with different numbers of extracted components). Select one solution and preparing an APA style results section (with table and figure). 8.8.1 Problem #1: Play around with this simulation. Copy the script for the simulation and then change (at least) one thing in the simulation to see how it impacts the results. If PCA is new to you, perhaps you just change the number in “set.seed(240311)” from 240311 to something else. Your results should parallel those obtained in the lecture, making it easier for you to check your work as you go. Don’t be surprised if the factor loadings wiggle around a little. Do try to make sense of them. 8.8.2 Problem #2: Conduct a PCA with another simulated set of data in the OER. The second option involves utilizing one of the simulated datasets available in this OER. The last lesson in the OER contains three simulations that could be used for all of the statistics-based practice suggestions. Especially if you started with one of these examples in an earlier lesson, I highly recommend you continue with that. Alternatively, Keum et al.’s Gendered Racial Microaggressions Scale for Asian American Women (Keum et al., 2018) will be used in the lessons on confirmatory factor analysis and Conover et al.’s (Conover et al., 2017) Ableist Microaggressions Scale is used in the lesson on invariance testing. Both of these would be suitable for the PCA and PAF homework assignments. 8.8.3 Problem #3: Try something entirely new. Using data for which you have permission and access (e.g., IRB approved data you have collected or from your lab; data you simulate from a published article; data from the ReCentering Psych Stats survey described in the Qualtrics lesson, or data from an open science repository), complete a PCA analysis. The data should allow for at least three factors/subscales. 8.8.4 Grading Rubric Using the lecture and workflow (chart) as a guide, please work through all the steps listed in the proposed assignment/grading rubric.

As a brief review, this data is part of an IRB-approved study, with consent to use in teaching demonstrations and to be made available to the general public via the open science framework. Hence, it is appropriate to use in this context. You will notice there are student- and teacher- IDs. These numbers are not actual student and teacher IDs, rather they were further re-identified so that they could not be connected to actual people. Because this is an actual dataset, if you wish to work the problem along with me, you will need to download the ReC.rds data file from the Worked_Examples folder in the ReC_Psychometrics project on the GitHub. The course evaluation items can be divided into three subscales: Valued by the student includes the items: ValObjectives, IncrUnderstanding, IncrInterest Traditional pedagogy includes the items: ClearResponsibilities, EffectiveAnswers, Feedback, ClearOrganization, ClearPresentation Socially responsive pedagogy includes the items: InclusvClassrm, EquitableEval, MultPerspectives, DEIintegration In this homewoRked example I will conduct a principal components analysis. My hope is that the results will support my solution of three dimensions: valued-by-the-student, traditional pedagogy, socially responsive pedagogy. 8.9.1 Check and, if needed, format data big &lt;- readRDS(&quot;ReC.rds&quot;) With the next code I will create an item-level df with only the items used in the three scales. library(tidyverse) items &lt;- big %&gt;% dplyr::select(ValObjectives, IncrUnderstanding, IncrInterest, ClearResponsibilities, EffectiveAnswers, Feedback, ClearOrganization, ClearPresentation, MultPerspectives, InclusvClassrm, DEIintegration, EquitableEval) Some of the analyses require non-missing data in the df. items &lt;- na.omit(items) Let’s check the structure of the data. str(items) Classes &#39;data.table&#39; and &#39;data.frame&#39;: 267 obs. of 12 variables: $ ValObjectives : int 5 5 4 4 5 5 5 4 5 3 ... $ IncrUnderstanding : int 2 3 4 3 4 5 2 4 5 4 ... $ IncrInterest : int 5 3 4 2 4 5 3 2 5 1 ... $ ClearResponsibilities: int 5 5 4 4 5 5 4 4 5 3 ... $ EffectiveAnswers : int 5 3 5 3 5 4 3 2 3 3 ... $ Feedback : int 5 3 4 2 5 5 4 4 5 2 ... $ ClearOrganization : int 3 4 3 4 4 5 4 4 5 2 ... $ ClearPresentation : int 4 4 4 2 5 4 4 4 5 2 ... $ MultPerspectives : int 5 5 4 5 5 5 5 5 5 1 ... $ InclusvClassrm : int 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 4 5 3 ... $ DEIintegration : int 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 ... $ EquitableEval : int 5 5 3 5 5 5 5 3 5 3 ... - attr(*, &quot;.internal.selfref&quot;)=&lt;externalptr&gt; - attr(*, &quot;na.action&quot;)= &#39;omit&#39; Named int [1:43] 6 20 106 109 112 113 114 117 122 128 ... ..- attr(*, &quot;names&quot;)= chr [1:43] &quot;6&quot; &quot;20&quot; &quot;106&quot; &quot;109&quot; ... 8.9.2 Conduct and interpret the three diagnostic tests to determine if PCA is appropriate as an analysis (KMO, Bartlett’s, determinant) 8.9.2.1 KMO The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) index is an index of sampling adequacy to let us know if the sample size is sufficient relative to the statistical characteristics of the data. General crieria (1974, Kaiser): bare minimum of .5 values between .5 and .7 as mediocre values between .7 and .8 are good values above .9 are superb psych::KMO(items) Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin factor adequacy Call: psych::KMO(r = items) Overall MSA = 0.91 MSA for each item = ValObjectives IncrUnderstanding IncrInterest 0.94 0.89 0.89 ClearResponsibilities EffectiveAnswers Feedback 0.91 0.93 0.94 ClearOrganization ClearPresentation MultPerspectives 0.94 0.91 0.93 InclusvClassrm DEIintegration EquitableEval 0.86 0.78 0.95 With a KMO of 0.91, the data seems appropriate to continue with the PCA. 8.9.2.2 Bartlett’s Barlett’s test let’s us know if the matrix is an identity matrix (i.e., where elements on the off-diagonal would be 0.0 and elements on the diagonal would be 1.0). Stated another way – items only correlate with “themselves” and not other variables. When \\(p &lt; 0.05\\) the matrix is not an identity matrix. That is, there are some relationships between variables that can be analyzed. psych::cortest.bartlett(items) R was not square, finding R from data $chisq [1] 1897.769 $p.value [1] 0 $df [1] 66 The Barlett’s test, \\(\\chi^2(66) = 1897.77, p &lt; 0.001\\), indicating that the correlation matrix is not an identity matrix and, on that dimension, is suitable for analysis. 8.9.2.3 Determinant Multicollinearity or singularity is diagnosed by the determinant. The determinant should be greater than 0.00001. If smaller, then there may be an issue with multicollinearity (variables that are too highly correlated) or singularity (variables that are perfectly correlated). items &lt;- na.omit(items) det(cor(items)) [1] 0.0006985496 The value of the determinant is 0.0007; greater than 0.00001. We are not concerned with multicollinearity or singularity. Summary from data screening: Data screening were conducted to determine the suitability of the data for this analyses. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy (KMO; Kaiser, 1970) represents the ratio of the squared correlation between variables to the squared partial correlation between variables. KMO ranges from 0.00 to 1.00; values closer to 1.00 indicate that the patterns of correlations are relatively compact and that component analysis should yield distinct and reliable components (Field, 2012). In our dataset, the KMO value was 0.91, indicating acceptable sampling adequacy. The Barlett’s Test of Sphericity examines whether the population correlation matrix resembles an identity matrix (Field, 2012). When the p value for the Bartlett’s test is &lt; .05, we are fairly certain we have clusters of correlated variables.

In the lecture I made a “biggish deal” about PCA being components (not factor) analysis. Although the two approaches can lead to similar results/conclusions, there are some significant differences “under the hood.” PCA can be thought of more as regression where the items predict the component. Consequently, the arrows go from the item, to the component. Starting with the next lesson, the arrows will go from the factor to the item – because the factors (or latent variables) are assumed to predict the scores on the items (i.e., “depression” would predict how someone rates items that assess hopelessness, sleep, anhedonia, and so forth).

These are high. Therefore, I will choose a 3-component, oblique, solution. 8.9.7 APA style results section with table and figure of one of the solutions The dimensionality of the 12 course evaluation items was analyzed using principal components analysis. First, data were screened to determine the suitability of the data for this analyses. Data screening were conducted to determine the suitability of the data for this analyses. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy (KMO; Kaiser, 1970) represents the ratio of the squared correlation between variables to the squared partial correlation between variables. KMO ranges from 0.00 to 1.00; values closer to 1.00 indicate that the patterns of correlations are relatively compact and that component analysis should yield distinct and reliable components (Field, 2012). In our dataset, the KMO value was 0.91, indicating acceptable sampling adequacy. The Barlett’s Test of Sphericity examines whether the population correlation matrix resembles an identity matrix (Field, 2012). When the p value for the Bartlett’s test is &lt; .05, we are fairly certain we have clusters of correlated variables. In our dataset, \\(\\chi^2(66) = 1897.77, p &lt; 0.001\\) indicating the correlations between items are sufficiently large enough for principal components analysis. The determinant of the correlation matrix alerts us to any issues of multicollinearity or singularity and should be larger than 0.00001. Our determinant was 0.0007 and, again, indicated that our data was suitable for the analysis. Four criteria were used to determine the number of components to extract: a priori theory, the scree test, the eigenvalue-greater-than-one criteria, and the interpretability of the solution. Kaiser’s eigenvalue-greater-than-one criteria suggested two components, and, in combination explained 63% of the variance. The inflexion in the scree plot justified retaining one component. A priorily, we researchers were expecting three components – which would explain 71% of the variance. Correspondingly, we investigated two and three component solutions with orthogonal (varimax) and oblique (oblimin) procedures. Given the significant correlations (ranging from .25 to .58) and the correspondence of items loading on the a priorili hypothesized components, we determined that an oblique, three-component, solution was most appropriate. The rotated solution, as shown in Table 1 and Figure 1, yielded three interpretable components, each listed with the proportion of variance accounted for: traditional pedagogy (35%), valued-by-me (21%), and socially and culturally responsive pedagogy (15%). Regarding the Table 1, I would include a table with ALL the values, bolding those with component membership.

This time the focus is on actual factor analysis. There are numerous approaches to this process (e.g., principal components analysis, parallel analyses). In this lesson I will demonstrate principal axis factoring (PAF). 9.1 Navigating this Lesson There is about an hour-and-a-half of lecture. If you work through the materials with me it would be plan for an additional two hours. While the majority of R objects and data you will need are created within the R script that sources the chapter, occasionally there are some that cannot be created from within the R framework. Additionally, sometimes links fail. All original materials are provided at the Github site that hosts the book. More detailed guidelines for ways to access all these materials are provided in the OER’s introduction 9.1.1 Learning Objectives Focusing on this lesson’s materials, make sure you can: Distinguish between PCA and PAF on several levels: recognize PCA and PAF from a path diagram define keywords associated with each: factor loadings, linear components, describe v. explain. Recognize/define an identity matrix – what test would you use to diagnose it? Recognize/define multicollinearity and singularity – what test would you use to diagnose it? Describe the desired pattern of “loadings” (i.e., the relative weights of an item on its own scale compared to other scales) Compare the results from item analysis, PCA, PAF, and omega. 9.1.2 Planning for Practice In each of these lessons I provide suggestions for practice that allow you to select one or more problems that are graded in difficulty. The least complex is to change the random seed in the research and rework the problem demonstrated in the lesson. The results should map onto the ones obtained in the lecture. The second option involves utilizing one of the simulated datasets available in this OER. The last lesson in the OER contains three simulations that could be used for all of the statistics-based practice suggestions. Especially if you started with one of these examples in an earlier lesson, I highly recommend you continue with that. Alternatively, Keum et al.’s Gendered Racial Microaggressions Scale for Asian American Women (2018) will be used in the lessons on confirmatory factor analysis and Conover et al.’s (2017) Ableist Microaggressions Scale is used in the lesson on invariance testing. Both of these would be suitable for the PCA and PAF homework assignments. As a third option, you are welcome to use data to which you have access and is suitable for PCA. These could include other vignettes from this OER, other simualated data, or your own data (presuming you have permission to use it). In any case, please plan to: Properly format and prepare the data. Conduct diagnostic tests to determine the suitability of the data for PCA. Conducting tests to guide the decisions about number of factors to extract. Conducting orthogonal and oblique extractions (at least two each with different numbers of factors). Selecting one solution and preparing an APA style results section (with table and figure). Compare your results in light of any other psychometrics lessons where you have used this data (especially the item analysis and PCA lessons). 9.1.3 Readings &amp; Resources In preparing this chapter, I drew heavily from the following resource(s).

Pages 13 through 24 provide technical information about what we are doing. 9.1.4 Packages The packages used in this lesson are embedded in this code. When the hashtags are removed, the script below will (a) check to see if the following packages are installed on your computer and, if not (b) install them. # will install the package if not already installed # if(!require(psych)){install.packages(&#39;psych&#39;)} # if(!require(tidyverse)){install.packages(&#39;tidyverse&#39;)} # if(!require(MASS)){install.packages(&#39;MASS&#39;)} # if(!require(sjstats)){install.packages(&#39;sjstats&#39;)} # if(!require(apaTables)){install.packages(&#39;apaTables&#39;)} # if(!require(qualtRics)){install.packages(&#39;qualtRics&#39;)} 9.2 Exploratory Factor Analysis (with a quick contrast to PCA) Whereas principal components analysis (PCA) is a regression analysis technique, principal factor analysis is a latent variable model (revelle_william_chapter_nodate?). Exploratory factor analysis has a rich history. In 1904, Spearman used it for a single factor. In 1947, Thurstone generalized it to multiple factors. Factor analysis is frequently used and controversial. Factor analysis and principal components are commonly confused: Principal components is linear sums of variables, solved with an eigenvalue or singular decomposition, represented by an \\(n*n\\) matrix in terms of the first k components and attempts to reproduce all of the \\(R\\) matrix, and paths which point from the items to a total scale score – all represented as observed/manifest (square) variables. Factor analysis is linear sums of unknown factors, estimated as best fitting solutions, normally through iterative procedures, and controversial. Because: At the structural level (i.e., covariance or correlation matrix), there are normally more observed variables than parameters to estimate them and the procedure seeks to find the best fitting solution using ordinary least squares, weighted least squares, or maximum likelihood. At the data level, although scores can be estimated, the model is indeterminate. This leads some to argue for using principal components; however fans of factor analysis suggest that it is useful for constructing and evaluating theories. an attempt to model only the common part of the matrix, which means all of the off-diagonal elements and the common part of the diagonal (the communalities); the uniquenesses are the non-common (leftover) part Stated another way, the factor model partitions the correlation or covariance matrix into common factors, \\(FF&#39;\\), and that which is unique, \\(U^2\\) (the diagonal matrix of uniquenesses) paths which point from the latent variable (LV) representing the factor (oval) to the items (squares) illustrating that the factor/LV “causes” the item’s score Comparison of path models for PCA and EFA Our focus today is on the PAF approach to scale construction. By utilizing the same research vignette as in the PCA lesson, we can identify similarities in differences in the approach, results, and interpretation. Let’s first take a look at the workflow for PAF. 9.3 PAF Workflow Below is a screenshot of the workflow. The original document is located in the Github site that hosts the ReCentering Psych Stats: Psychometrics OER. You may find it refreshing that, with the exception of the change from “components” to “factors,” the workflow for PCA and PAF are quite similar. Image of the workflow for PAF Steps in the process include: Creating an items only dataframe where all items are scaled in the same direction (i.e., negatively worded items are reverse-scored). Conducting tests that assess the statistical assumptions of PAF to ensure that the data is appropriate for PAF. Determining the number of factors (think “subscales”) to extract. Conducting the factor extraction – this process will likely occur iteratively, exploring orthogonal (uncorrelated/independent) and oblique (correlated) factors, and changing the number of factors to extract Because the intended audience for the ReCentering Psych Stats OER is the scientist-practitioner-advocate, this lesson focuses on the workflow and decisions. As you might guess, the details of PAF can be quite complex. Some important notions to consider that may not be obvious from lesson, are these: The values of factor loadings are directly related to the correlation matrix. Although I do not explain this in detail, nearly every analytic step attempts to convey this notion by presenting equivalent analytic options using the raw data and correlation matrix. PAF (like PCA and related EFA procecures) is about dimension reduction – our goal is fewer factors (think subscales) than there are items. In this lesson’s vignette there are 25 items on the scale and we will have 4 subscales. As a latent variable procedure, PAF is both exploratory and factor analysis. This is in contrast to our prior PCA lesson. Recall that PCA is a regression-based model and therefore not “factor analysis.” Matrix algebra (e.g., using the transpose of a matrix, multiplying matrices together) plays a critical role in the analytic solution. 9.4 Research Vignette This lesson’s research vignette emerges from Lewis and Neville’s Gendered Racial Microaggressions Scale for Black Women (2015). The article reports on two separate studies that comprised the development, refinement, and psychometric evaluation of two parallel versions (stress appraisal, frequency) of the scale. Below, I simulate data from the final construction of the stress appraisal version as the basis of the lecture. Items were on a 6-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all stressful) to 5 (extremely stressful). Lewis and Neville (2015) reported support for a total scale score (25 items) and four subscales. Below, I list the four subscales along with the items and their abbreviation. At the outset, let me provide a content advisory. For those who hold this particular identity (or related identities) the content in the items may be upsetting. In other lessons, I often provide a variable name that gives an indication of the primary content of the item. In the case of the GRMS, I will simply provide an abbreviation of the subscale name and its respective item number. This will allow us to easily inspect the alignment of the item with its intended factor, and hopefully minimize discomfort. If you are not a member of this particular identity, I encourage you to learn about these microaggressions by reading the article in its entirety. Please do not ask members of this group to explain why these microaggressions are harmful or ask if they have encountered them. The four factors, number of items, and sample item are as follows: Assumptions of Beauty and Sexual Objectification (10 items) Unattractive because of size of butt (Obj1) Negative comments about size of facial features (Obj2) Imitated the way they think Black women speak (Obj3) Someone made me feel unattractive (Obj4) Negative comment about skin tone (Obj5) Someone assumed I speak a certain way (Obj6) Objectified me based on physical features(Obj7) Someone assumed I have a certain body type (Obj8; stress only) Made a sexually inappropriate comment (Obj9) Negative comments about my hair when natural (Obj10) Assumed I was sexually promiscuous (frequency only; not used in this simulation) Silenced and Marginalized (7 items) I have felt unheard (Marg1) My comments have been ignored (Marg2) Someone challenged my authority (Marg3) I have been disrespected in workplace (Marg4) Someone has tried to “put me in my place” (Marg5) Felt excluded from networking opportunities (Marg6) Assumed I did not have much to contribute to the conversation (Marg7) Strong Black Woman Stereotype (5 items) Someone assumed I was sassy and straightforward (Str1; stress only) I have been told that I am too independent (Str2) Someone made me feel exotic as a Black woman (Str2; stress only) I have been told that I am too assertive Assumed to be a strong Black woman Angry Black Woman Stereotype (3 items) Someone has told me to calm down (Ang1) Perceived to be “angry Black woman” (Ang2) Someone accused me of being angry when speaking calm (Ang3) Three additional scales were reported in the Lewis and Neville article (2015). Because (a) the focus of this lesson is on exploratory factor analytic approaches and, therefore, only requires item-level data for the scale, and (b) the article does not include correlations between the subscales/scales of all involved measures, I only simulated item-level data for the GRMS items. Below, I walk through the data simulation. This is not an essential portion of the lesson, but I will lecture it in case you are interested. None of the items are negatively worded (relative to the other items), so there is no need to reverse-score any items. Simulating the data involved using factor loadings, means, standard deviations, and correlations between the scales. Because the simulation will produce “out-of-bounds” values, the code below rescales the scores into the range of the Likert-type scaling and rounds them to whole values. # Entering the intercorrelations, means, and standard deviations from # the journal article LewisGRMS_generating_model &lt;- &quot; #measurement model Objectification =~ .69*Obj1 + .69*Obj2 + .60*Obj3 + .59*Obj4 + .55*Obj5 + .55*Obj6 + .54*Obj7 + .50*Obj8 + .41*Obj9 + .41*Obj10 Marginalized =~ .93*Marg1 + .81*Marg2 +.69*Marg3 + .67*Marg4 + .61*Marg5 + .58*Marg6 +.54*Marg7 Strong =~ .59*Str1 + .55*Str2 + .54*Str3 + .54*Str4 + .51*Str5 Angry =~ .70*Ang1 + .69*Ang2 + .68*Ang3 #Means Objectification ~ 1.85*1 Marginalized ~ 2.67*1 Strong ~ 1.61*1 Angry ~ 2.29*1 #Correlations Objectification ~~ .63*Marginalized Objectification ~~ .66*Strong Objectification ~~ .51*Angry Marginalized ~~ .59*Strong Marginalized ~~ .62*Angry Strong ~~ .61*Angry &quot; set.seed(240311) dfGRMS &lt;- lavaan::simulateData(model = LewisGRMS_generating_model, model.type = &quot;sem&quot;, meanstructure = T, sample.nobs = 259, standardized = FALSE) # used to retrieve column indices used in the rescaling script below col_index &lt;- as.data.frame(colnames(dfGRMS)) # The code below loops through each column of the dataframe and # assigns the scaling accordingly Rows 1 thru 26 are the GRMS items for (i in 1:ncol(dfGRMS)) { if (i &gt;= 1 &amp; i &lt;= 25) { dfGRMS[, i] &lt;- scales::rescale(dfGRMS[, i], c(0, 5)) } } # rounding to integers so that the data resembles that which was # collected library(tidyverse) dfGRMS &lt;- dfGRMS %&gt;% round(0) # quick check of my work psych::describe(dfGRMS) The optional script below will let you save the simulated data to your computing environment as either an .rds object (preserves any formatting you might do) or a .csv file (think “Excel lite”). An .rds file preserves all formatting to variables prior to the export and re-import. For the purpose of this chapter, you don’t need to do either. That is, you can re-simulate the data each time you work the problem. # to save the df as an .rds (think &#39;R object&#39;) file on your computer; # it should save in the same file as the .rmd file you are working # with saveRDS(dfGRMS, &#39;dfGRMS.rds&#39;) bring back the simulated dat # from an .rds file dfGRMS &lt;- readRDS(&#39;dfGRMS.rds&#39;) If you save the .csv file and bring it back in, you will lose any formatting (e.g., ordered factors will be interpreted as character variables). #write the simulated data as a .csv #write.table(dfGRMS, file=&quot;dfGRMS.csv&quot;, sep=&quot;,&quot;, col.names=TRUE, row.names=FALSE) #bring back the simulated dat from a .csv file #dfGRMS &lt;- read.csv (&quot;dfGRMS.csv&quot;, header = TRUE) Before moving on, I want to acknowledge that (at their first drafting), I try to select research vignettes that have been published within the prior 5 years. With a publication date of 2015, this article clearly falls outside that range. I have continued to include it because (a) the scholarship is superior – especially as the measure captures an intersectional identity, (b) the article has been a model for research that follows (e.g., Keum et al’s (2018) Gendered Racial Microaggression Scale for Asian American Women), and (c) there is often a time lag between the initial publication of a psychometric scale and it’s use. A key reason I have retained the GRMS as a psychometrics research vignette is that in ReCentering Psych Stats: Multivariate Modeling, GRMS scales are used in a couple of more recently published research vignettes. 9.5 Working the Vignette It may be useful to recall how we might understand factors in the psychometric sense: clusters of correlated items in an \\(R\\)-matrix statistical entities that can be plotted as classification axes where coordinates of variables along each axis represen the strength of the relationship between that variable to each factor. mathematical equations, resembling regression equations, where each variable is represented according to its relative weight 9.5.1 Data Prep Since the first step is data preparation, let’s start by: reverse coding any items that are phrased in the opposite direction creating a df (as an object) that only contains the items in their properly scored direction (i.e., you might need to replace the original item with the reverse-coded item); there should be no other variables (e.g., ID, demographic variables, other scales) in this df because the GRMS has no items like this we can skip these two steps Our example today requires no reverse coding and the dataset I simulated only has item-level data (with no ID and no other variables). This means we are ready to start the PAF process. Let’s take a look at (and make an object of) the correlation matrix.

I will do both to demonstrate (a) that it’s possible and to (b) continue emphasizing that this is a structural analysis. That is, we are trying to see if our more parsimonious extraction reproduces this original correlation matrix. 9.5.1.1 Three Diagnostic Tests to Evaluate the Appropriateness of the Data for Factor (or Component))Analysis Here’s a snip of our location in the PAF workflow. Image of our location in the PAF workflow 9.5.1.1.1 Is my sample adequate for PAF? We return to the KMO (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin), an index of sampling adequacy that can be used with the actual sample to let us know if the sample size is sufficient (or if we should collect more data). Kaiser’s 1974 recommendations were: bare minimum of .5 values between .5 and .7 are mediocre values between .7 and .8 are good values above .9 are superb We use the KMO() function from the psych package with either raw or matrix dat. psych::KMO(dfGRMS) Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin factor adequacy Call: psych::KMO(r = dfGRMS) Overall MSA = 0.85 MSA for each item = Obj1 Obj2 Obj3 Obj4 Obj5 Obj6 Obj7 Obj8 Obj9 Obj10 Marg1 Marg2 Marg3 0.87 0.91 0.88 0.85 0.85 0.80 0.90 0.85 0.81 0.85 0.86 0.89 0.86 Marg4 Marg5 Marg6 Marg7 Str1 Str2 Str3 Str4 Str5 Ang1 Ang2 Ang3 0.86 0.90 0.89 0.84 0.83 0.85 0.82 0.74 0.84 0.78 0.76 0.81 # psych::KMO(GRMSr) #for the KMO function, do not specify sample size # if using the matrix form of the data We examine the KMO values for both the overall matrix and the individual items. At the matrix level, our \\(KMO = .85\\), which falls in between Kaiser’s definitions of good and superb. At the item level, the KMO should be &gt; .50. Variables with values below .5 should be evaluated for exclusion from the analysis (or run the analysis with and without the variable and compare the difference). Because removing/adding variables impacts the KMO, be sure to re-evaluate. At the item level, our KMO values range between .74 (Str4) and .91 (Obj2). Considering both item- and matrix- levels, we conclude that the sample size and the data are adequate for factor (or component) analysis. 9.5.1.1.2 Are the correlations among the variables big enough to be analyzed? Bartlett’s lets us know if a matrix is an identity matrix. In an identity matrix all correlation coefficients (everything on the off-diagonal) would be 0.0 (and everything on the diagonal would be 1.0). A significant Barlett’s (i.e., \\(p &lt; .05\\)) tells that the \\(R\\)-matrix is not an identity matrix. That is, there are some relationships between variables that can be analyzed. The cortest.bartlett() function in the psych package and can be run either from the raw data or R matrix formats. psych::cortest.bartlett(dfGRMS) #from the raw data R was not square, finding R from data $chisq [1] 1217.508 $p.value [1] 0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001107085 $df [1] 300 # raw data produces the warning &#39;R was not square, finding R from # data.&#39; This means nothing other than we fed it raw data and the # function is creating a matrix from which to do the analysis. # psych::cortest.bartlett(GRMSr, n = 259) #if using the matrix, must # specify sample size Our Bartlett’s test is significant: \\(\\chi^{2}(300)=1217.508, p &lt; .001\\). This supports a factor (or component) analytic approach for investigating the data. 9.5.1.1.3 Is there multicollinearity or singularity in my data? The determinant of the correlation matrix should be greater than 0.00001 (that would be 4 zeros before the 1). If it is smaller than 0.00001 then we may have an issue with multicollinearity (i.e., variables that are too highly correlated) or singularity (variables that are perfectly correlated). The determinant function comes from base R. It is easiest to compute when the correlation matrix is the object. However, it is also possible to specify the command to work with the raw data. # det(GRMSr) det(cor(dfGRMS)) #if using the raw data [1] 0.007499909 With a value of 0.0075, our determinant is greater than the 0.00001 requirement. If it were not, then we could identify problematic variables (i.e., those correlating too highly with others and those not correlating sufficiently with others) and re-run the diagnostic statistics. 9.5.1.2 APA Style Summary So Far Data screening were conducted to determine the suitability of the data for this analyses. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy (KMO; Kaiser, 1970) represents the ratio of the squared correlation between variables to the squared partial correlation between variables. KMO ranges from 0.00 to 1.00; values closer to 1.00 indicate that the patterns of correlations are relatively compact and that factor analysis should yield distinct and reliable factors (Field, 2012). In our dataset, the KMO value was .85, indicating acceptable sampling adequacy. The Barlett’s Test of Sphericity examines whether the population correlation matrix resembles an identity matrix (Field, 2012). When the p value for the Bartlett’s test is &lt; .05, we are fairly certain we have clusters of correlated variables. In our dataset, \\(\\chi^{2}(300)=1217.508, p &lt; .001\\), indicating the correlations between items are sufficiently large enough for principal axis factoring. The determinant of the correlation matrix alerts us to any issues of multicollinearity or singularity and should be larger than 0.00001. Our determinant was 0.0075, supporting the suitability of our data for analysis. Note: If this looks familiar, it is! The same diagnostics are used in PAF and PCA. 9.5.2 Principal Axis Factoring (PAF) Here’s a snip of our location in the PAF workflow. Image of our location in the PAF workflow We can use the fa() function, specifying fm = “pa” from the psych package with raw or matrix data. One difference from PCA is that factor analysis will not (cannot) calculate as many factors as there are items. This means that we should select a reasonable number, like 20 (since there are 25 items). However, I received a number of errors/warnings and 13 is the first number that would run. I also received the warning, “maximum iteration exceeded.” Therefore I increased “max.iter” to 100. Our goal is to begin to get an idea of the cumulative variance explained and number of factors to extract.

Random variance is also specific to one item, but not reliably so. We can examine this most easily by examining the matrix (second screen). The columns PA1 thru PA10 are the (uninteresting at this point) unrotated loadings. These are the loading from each factor to each variable. PA stands for “principal axis.” Scrolling to the far right we are interested in: Communalities are represented as \\(h^2\\). These are the proportions of common variance present in the variables. A variable that has no specific (or random) variance would have a communality of 1.0. If a variable shares none of its variance with any other variable, its communality would be 0.0. As a point of comparison, in PCA these started as 1.0 because we extracted the same number of components as items. In PAF, because we must extract fewer factors than items, these will have unique values. **Uniquenesses* are represented as \\(u2\\). These are the amount of unique variance for each variable. They are calculated as \\(1 - h^2\\) (or 1 minus the communality). The final column, com represents item complexity. This is an indication of how well an item reflects a single construct. If it is 1.0 then the item loads only on one factor, if it is 2.0, it loads evenly on two factors, and so forth. For now, we can ignore this. I mostly wanted to reassure you that “com” is not “communality” – h2 is communality. Let’s switch to the first screen of output. Eigenvalues are displayed in the row called, SS loadings (i.e., the sum of squared loadings). They represent the variance explained by the particular linear factor. PA1 explains 4.86 units of variance (out of a possible 25; the # of potential factors). As a proportion, this is 4.86/25 = 0.1944 (reported in the Proportion Var row). We inspect the eigenvalues to see how many are &gt; 1.0 (Kaiser’s eigenvalue &gt; 1 criteria criteria). We see there are three that meet Kaiser’s critera and four that meet Joliffe’s criteria (eigenvalues &gt; .70). 4.86/25 [1] 0.1944 Cumulative Var is helpful to determine how many factors we’d like to retain to balance parsimony (few as possible) with the amount of variance we want to explain. Directly related to the eigenvalues, we can see how including each additional factor accounts for a greater proportion of variance. Scree plots can help us visualize the relationship between the eigenvalues. A rule of thumb is to select the number of factors that is associated with the number of dots before the flattening of the curve. Eigenvalues are stored in the grmsPAF1 object’s variable, “values”. We can see all the values captured by this object with the names() function: names(grmsPAF1) [1] &quot;residual&quot; &quot;dof&quot; &quot;chi&quot; [4] &quot;nh&quot; &quot;rms&quot; &quot;EPVAL&quot; [7] &quot;crms&quot; &quot;EBIC&quot; &quot;ESABIC&quot; [10] &quot;fit&quot; &quot;fit.off&quot; &quot;sd&quot; [13] &quot;factors&quot; &quot;complexity&quot; &quot;n.obs&quot; [16] &quot;objective&quot; &quot;criteria&quot; &quot;STATISTIC&quot; [19] &quot;PVAL&quot; &quot;Call&quot; &quot;null.model&quot; [22] &quot;null.dof&quot; &quot;null.chisq&quot; &quot;TLI&quot; [25] &quot;F0&quot; &quot;RMSEA&quot; &quot;BIC&quot; [28] &quot;SABIC&quot; &quot;r.scores&quot; &quot;R2&quot; [31] &quot;valid&quot; &quot;score.cor&quot; &quot;weights&quot; [34] &quot;rotation&quot; &quot;hyperplane&quot; &quot;communality&quot; [37] &quot;communalities&quot; &quot;uniquenesses&quot; &quot;values&quot; [40] &quot;e.values&quot; &quot;loadings&quot; &quot;model&quot; [43] &quot;fm&quot; &quot;Structure&quot; &quot;communality.iterations&quot; [46] &quot;method&quot; &quot;scores&quot; &quot;R2.scores&quot; [49] &quot;r&quot; &quot;np.obs&quot; &quot;fn&quot; [52] &quot;Vaccounted&quot; plot(grmsPAF1$values, type = &quot;b&quot;) #type = &quot;b&quot; gives us &quot;both&quot; lines and points; type = &quot;l&quot; gives lines and is relatively worthless We look for the point of inflexion. That is, where the baseline levels out into a plateau. I can see inflections after 1, 2, 3, and 4. 9.5.2.1 Specifying the number of factors Here’s a snip of our location in the PAF workflow. Image of our location in the PAF workflow Having determined the number of factors, we must rerun the analysis with this specification. Especially when researchers may not have a clear theoretical structure that guides the process, researchers may do this iteratively with varying numbers of factors. Lewis and Neville (J. A. Lewis &amp; Neville, 2015) examined solutions with 2, 3, 4, and 5 factors (they conducted a parallel factor analysis; in contrast this lesson demonstrates principal axis factoring). # grmsPAF2 &lt;- psych::fa(GRMSr, nfactors=4, fm = &#39;pa&#39;, rotate=&#39;none&#39;) grmsPAF2 &lt;- psych::fa(dfGRMS, nfactors = 4, fm = &quot;pa&quot;, rotate = &quot;none&quot;) #can copy prior script, but change nfactors and object name grmsPAF2 Factor Analysis using method = pa Call: psych::fa(r = dfGRMS, nfactors = 4, rotate = &quot;none&quot;, fm = &quot;pa&quot;) Standardized loadings (pattern matrix) based upon correlation matrix PA1 PA2 PA3 PA4 h2 u2 com Obj1 0.48 -0.24 0.02 0.02 0.29 0.71 1.5 Obj2 0.52 -0.22 -0.02 0.06 0.32 0.68 1.4 Obj3 0.45 -0.20 0.02 0.05 0.25 0.75 1.4 Obj4 0.49 -0.27 -0.12 0.03 0.33 0.67 1.7 Obj5 0.47 -0.23 0.03 -0.05 0.28 0.72 1.5 Obj6 0.37 -0.15 0.00 0.26 0.22 0.78 2.2 Obj7 0.51 -0.09 -0.02 0.02 0.27 0.73 1.1 Obj8 0.45 -0.31 -0.16 -0.16 0.35 0.65 2.4 Obj9 0.37 -0.21 0.08 -0.02 0.19 0.81 1.7 Obj10 0.38 -0.23 -0.02 0.14 0.22 0.78 2.0 Marg1 0.58 0.36 -0.31 -0.23 0.62 0.38 2.6 Marg2 0.55 0.31 0.00 -0.09 0.41 0.59 1.6 Marg3 0.48 0.19 -0.09 -0.09 0.28 0.72 1.5 Marg4 0.46 0.11 -0.24 0.01 0.28 0.72 1.6 Marg5 0.53 0.16 -0.11 -0.11 0.33 0.67 1.4 Marg6 0.50 0.01 -0.12 0.06 0.27 0.73 1.2 Marg7 0.37 0.16 -0.13 -0.03 0.18 0.82 1.6 Str1 0.40 0.04 0.38 -0.24 0.36 0.64 2.6 Str2 0.36 -0.01 0.21 0.08 0.18 0.82 1.7 Str3 0.30 0.10 0.41 -0.08 0.28 0.72 2.1 Str4 0.26 -0.03 0.29 -0.11 0.17 0.83 2.3 Str5 0.31 0.09 0.27 0.04 0.18 0.82 2.2 Ang1 0.32 0.24 0.24 0.08 0.22 0.78 3.0 Ang2 0.31 0.31 0.01 0.49 0.43 0.57 2.5 Ang3 0.35 0.21 0.03 0.17 0.19 0.81 2.1 PA1 PA2 PA3 PA4 SS loadings 4.67 1.03 0.83 0.57 Proportion Var 0.19 0.04 0.03 0.02 Cumulative Var 0.19 0.23 0.26 0.28 Proportion Explained 0.66 0.15 0.12 0.08 Cumulative Proportion 0.66 0.80 0.92 1.00 Mean item complexity = 1.9 Test of the hypothesis that 4 factors are sufficient. df null model = 300 with the objective function = 4.89 with Chi Square = 1217.51 df of the model are 206 and the objective function was 0.77 The root mean square of the residuals (RMSR) is 0.04 The df corrected root mean square of the residuals is 0.04 The harmonic n.obs is 259 with the empirical chi square 202.41 with prob &lt; 0.56 The total n.obs was 259 with Likelihood Chi Square = 189.19 with prob &lt; 0.79 Tucker Lewis Index of factoring reliability = 1.027 RMSEA index = 0 and the 90 % confidence intervals are 0 0.018 BIC = -955.52 Fit based upon off diagonal values = 0.97 Measures of factor score adequacy PA1 PA2 PA3 PA4 Correlation of (regression) scores with factors 0.93 0.79 0.74 0.70 Multiple R square of scores with factors 0.87 0.62 0.55 0.48 Minimum correlation of possible factor scores 0.75 0.24 0.11 -0.03 Our eigenvalues/SS loadings wiggle around a bit from the initial run. With four factors, we now, cumulatively, explain 28% of the variance. Communality is the proportion of common variance within a variable. Changing from 13 to 4 factors changed these values (\\(h2\\)) as well as their associated uniquenesses (\\(u2\\)), which are calculated as “1.0 minus the communality.” Now we see that 29% of the variance associated with Obj1 is common/shared (the \\(h2\\) value). As a reminder of what we are doing, recall that we are looking for a more parsimonious explanation than 25 items on the GRMS. By respecifying a smaller number of factors, we lose some information. That is, the retained factors (now 4) cannot explain all of the variance present in the data (as we saw, it explains about 28%, cumulatively). The amount of variance explained in each variable is represented by the communalities after extraction. We can also inspect the communalities through the lens of Kaiser’s criterion (the eigenvalue &gt; 1 criteria) to see if we think that four was a good number of factors to extract. Kaiser’s criterion is believed to be accurate: when there are fewer than 30 variables (we had 25) and, after extraction, the communalities are greater than .70 looking at our data, none of the communalities is &gt; .70, so, this does not support extracting four factors When the sample size is greater than 250 (ours was 259) and the average communality is &gt; .60 calculated below, ours was .28. Using the names() function again, we see that “communality” is available for manipulation. names(grmsPAF2) [1] &quot;residual&quot; &quot;dof&quot; &quot;chi&quot; [4] &quot;nh&quot; &quot;rms&quot; &quot;EPVAL&quot; [7] &quot;crms&quot; &quot;EBIC&quot; &quot;ESABIC&quot; [10] &quot;fit&quot; &quot;fit.off&quot; &quot;sd&quot; [13] &quot;factors&quot; &quot;complexity&quot; &quot;n.obs&quot; [16] &quot;objective&quot; &quot;criteria&quot; &quot;STATISTIC&quot; [19] &quot;PVAL&quot; &quot;Call&quot; &quot;null.model&quot; [22] &quot;null.dof&quot; &quot;null.chisq&quot; &quot;TLI&quot; [25] &quot;F0&quot; &quot;RMSEA&quot; &quot;BIC&quot; [28] &quot;SABIC&quot; &quot;r.scores&quot; &quot;R2&quot; [31] &quot;valid&quot; &quot;score.cor&quot; &quot;weights&quot; [34] &quot;rotation&quot; &quot;hyperplane&quot; &quot;communality&quot; [37] &quot;communalities&quot; &quot;uniquenesses&quot; &quot;values&quot; [40] &quot;e.values&quot; &quot;loadings&quot; &quot;model&quot; [43] &quot;fm&quot; &quot;Structure&quot; &quot;communality.iterations&quot; [46] &quot;method&quot; &quot;scores&quot; &quot;R2.scores&quot; [49] &quot;r&quot; &quot;np.obs&quot; &quot;fn&quot; [52] &quot;Vaccounted&quot; We can use this value to calculate their mean. mean(grmsPAF2$communality) [1] 0.2840516 # sum(grmsPAF2$communality) # We see that our average communality is 0.28. These two criteria suggest that we may not have the best solution. That said (in our defense): We used the scree plot as a guide and it was very clear. We have an adequate sample size and that was supported with the KMO. Are the number of factors consistent with theory? We have not yet inspected the factor loadings. This will provide us with more information. We could do several things: rerun with a different number of factors (recall Lewis and Neville (2015) ran models with 2, 3, 4, and 5 factors) conduct more diagnostics tests reproduced correlation matrix the difference between the reproduced correlation matrix and the correlation matrix from the data The factor.model() function in psych produces the reproduced correlation matrix by using the loadings in our extracted object. Conceptually, this matrix is the correlations that should be produced if we did not have the raw data but we only had the factor loadings. The questions, though, is: How close did we get? How different is the reproduced correlation matrix from GRMSmatrix – the \\(R\\)-matrix produced from our raw data. round(psych::factor.model(grmsPAF2$loadings), 3) #produces the reproduced correlation matrix Obj1 Obj2 Obj3 Obj4 Obj5 Obj6 Obj7 Obj8 Obj9 Obj10 Marg1 Marg2 Obj1 0.293 0.304 0.270 0.300 0.284 0.219 0.270 0.287 0.229 0.242 0.187 0.193 Obj2 0.304 0.319 0.282 0.317 0.291 0.239 0.286 0.294 0.232 0.256 0.215 0.212 Obj3 0.270 0.282 0.250 0.277 0.260 0.209 0.252 0.258 0.209 0.225 0.178 0.185 Obj4 0.300 0.317 0.277 0.326 0.288 0.229 0.279 0.317 0.225 0.255 0.219 0.186 Obj5 0.284 0.291 0.260 0.288 0.280 0.196 0.261 0.287 0.226 0.225 0.193 0.194 Obj6 0.219 0.239 0.209 0.229 0.196 0.225 0.207 0.169 0.161 0.210 0.097 0.131 Obj7 0.270 0.286 0.252 0.279 0.261 0.207 0.273 0.260 0.205 0.218 0.271 0.256 Obj8 0.287 0.294 0.258 0.317 0.287 0.169 0.260 0.353 0.221 0.223 0.242 0.170 Obj9 0.229 0.232 0.209 0.225 0.226 0.161 0.205 0.221 0.186 0.183 0.118 0.140 Obj10 0.242 0.256 0.225 0.255 0.225 0.210 0.218 0.223 0.183 0.217 0.113 0.126 Marg1 0.187 0.215 0.178 0.219 0.193 0.097 0.271 0.242 0.118 0.113 0.619 0.455 Marg2 0.193 0.212 0.185 0.186 0.194 0.131 0.256 0.170 0.140 0.126 0.455 0.411 Marg3 0.182 0.201 0.173 0.191 0.182 0.121 0.228 0.187 0.129 0.126 0.393 0.329 Marg4 0.195 0.221 0.186 0.226 0.185 0.155 0.234 0.212 0.127 0.158 0.378 0.287 Marg5 0.213 0.233 0.201 0.225 0.213 0.140 0.257 0.225 0.153 0.151 0.424 0.350 Marg6 0.239 0.263 0.227 0.259 0.227 0.197 0.261 0.233 0.169 0.199 0.322 0.276 Marg7 0.140 0.159 0.134 0.154 0.136 0.105 0.180 0.145 0.093 0.104 0.320 0.257 Str1 0.188 0.177 0.171 0.136 0.206 0.082 0.191 0.148 0.177 0.103 0.187 0.258 Str2 0.184 0.190 0.174 0.160 0.178 0.155 0.184 0.122 0.151 0.147 0.124 0.189 Str3 0.128 0.119 0.120 0.072 0.137 0.075 0.136 0.053 0.126 0.071 0.105 0.207 Str4 0.135 0.126 0.122 0.097 0.144 0.070 0.126 0.097 0.128 0.082 0.075 0.145 Str5 0.134 0.136 0.128 0.097 0.132 0.111 0.145 0.061 0.116 0.097 0.115 0.193 Ang1 0.101 0.110 0.103 0.066 0.098 0.101 0.138 0.016 0.083 0.070 0.176 0.242 Ang2 0.087 0.123 0.102 0.085 0.052 0.193 0.143 -0.037 0.038 0.114 0.177 0.223 Ang3 0.125 0.146 0.126 0.120 0.111 0.141 0.165 0.063 0.084 0.109 0.231 0.243 Marg3 Marg4 Marg5 Marg6 Marg7 Str1 Str2 Str3 Str4 Str5 Ang1 Ang2 Obj1 0.182 0.195 0.213 0.239 0.140 0.188 0.184 0.128 0.135 0.134 0.101 0.087 Obj2 0.201 0.221 0.233 0.263 0.159 0.177 0.190 0.119 0.126 0.136 0.110 0.123 Obj3 0.173 0.186 0.201 0.227 0.134 0.171 0.174 0.120 0.122 0.128 0.103 0.102 Obj4 0.191 0.226 0.225 0.259 0.154 0.136 0.160 0.072 0.097 0.097 0.066 0.085 Obj5 0.182 0.185 0.213 0.227 0.136 0.206 0.178 0.137 0.144 0.132 0.098 0.052 Obj6 0.121 0.155 0.140 0.197 0.105 0.082 0.155 0.075 0.070 0.111 0.101 0.193 Obj7 0.228 0.234 0.257 0.261 0.180 0.191 0.184 0.136 0.126 0.145 0.138 0.143 Obj8 0.187 0.212 0.225 0.233 0.145 0.148 0.122 0.053 0.097 0.061 0.016 -0.037 Obj9 0.129 0.127 0.153 0.169 0.093 0.177 0.151 0.126 0.128 0.116 0.083 0.038 Obj10 0.126 0.158 0.151 0.199 0.104 0.103 0.147 0.071 0.082 0.097 0.070 0.114 Marg1 0.393 0.378 0.424 0.322 0.320 0.187 0.124 0.105 0.075 0.115 0.176 0.177 Marg2 0.329 0.287 0.350 0.276 0.257 0.258 0.189 0.207 0.145 0.193 0.242 0.223 Marg3 0.277 0.260 0.300 0.247 0.220 0.185 0.143 0.132 0.100 0.133 0.165 0.161 Marg4 0.260 0.281 0.286 0.264 0.219 0.098 0.117 0.052 0.045 0.087 0.116 0.182 Marg5 0.300 0.286 0.326 0.274 0.238 0.201 0.156 0.137 0.110 0.140 0.168 0.160 Marg6 0.247 0.264 0.274 0.271 0.203 0.142 0.160 0.097 0.085 0.123 0.136 0.189 Marg7 0.220 0.219 0.238 0.203 0.181 0.113 0.103 0.077 0.056 0.091 0.122 0.151 Str1 0.185 0.098 0.201 0.142 0.113 0.363 0.206 0.300 0.241 0.221 0.209 0.025 Str2 0.143 0.117 0.156 0.160 0.103 0.206 0.179 0.186 0.146 0.170 0.167 0.146 Str3 0.132 0.052 0.137 0.097 0.077 0.300 0.186 0.276 0.205 0.210 0.212 0.087 Str4 0.100 0.045 0.110 0.085 0.056 0.241 0.146 0.205 0.167 0.152 0.136 0.018 Str5 0.133 0.087 0.140 0.123 0.091 0.221 0.170 0.210 0.152 0.178 0.187 0.145 Ang1 0.165 0.116 0.168 0.136 0.122 0.209 0.167 0.212 0.136 0.187 0.223 0.215 Ang2 0.161 0.182 0.160 0.189 0.151 0.025 0.146 0.087 0.018 0.145 0.215 0.431 Ang3 0.187 0.180 0.196 0.186 0.155 0.120 0.142 0.123 0.073 0.140 0.181 0.256 Ang3 Obj1 0.125 Obj2 0.146 Obj3 0.126 Obj4 0.120 Obj5 0.111 Obj6 0.141 Obj7 0.165 Obj8 0.063 Obj9 0.084 Obj10 0.109 Marg1 0.231 Marg2 0.243 Marg3 0.187 Marg4 0.180 Marg5 0.196 Marg6 0.186 Marg7 0.155 Str1 0.120 Str2 0.142 Str3 0.123 Str4 0.073 Str5 0.140 Ang1 0.181 Ang2 0.256 Ang3 0.195 We’re not really interested in this matrix. We just need it to compare it to the GRMSmatrix to produce the residuals. We do that next. Residuals are the difference between the reproduced (i.e., those created from our factor loadings) and \\(R\\)-matrix produced by the raw data. If we look at the \\(r_{_{Obj1Obj2}}\\) in our original correlation matrix (theoretically from the raw data [although we simulated data]), the value is 0.35.

Compare the size of the residuals to the original correlations. The worst possible model would occur if we extracted no factors and the residuals are the size of the original correlations. If the correlations were small to start with, we expect small residuals. If the correlations were large to start with, the residuals will be relatively larger (this is not terribly problematic). Comparing residuals requires squaring them first (because residuals can be both positive and negative) The sum of the squared residuals divided by the sum of the squared correlations is an estimate of model fit. Subtracting this from 1.0 means that it ranges from 0 to 1. Values &gt; .95 are an indication of good fit. Analyzing the residuals means we need to extract only the upper right of the triangle them into an object. We can do this in steps. grmsPAF2_resids &lt;- psych::factor.residuals(GRMSr, grmsPAF2$loadings) #first extract the resids grmsPAF2_resids &lt;- as.matrix(grmsPAF2_resids[upper.tri(grmsPAF2_resids)]) #the object has the residuals in a single column head(grmsPAF2_resids) [,1] [1,] 0.05128890 [2,] -0.01969873 [3,] 0.03041703 [4,] -0.02971380 [5,] -0.06927144 [6,] -0.03556489 # unhashtag for a view of all the residuals grmsPAF2_resids One criteria of residual analysis is to see how many residuals there are that are greater than an absolute value of 0.05. The result will be a single column with TRUE if it is &gt; |0.05| and false if it is smaller. The sum function will tell us how many TRUE responses are in the matrix. Further, we can write script to obtain the proportion of total number of residuals. large.resid &lt;- abs(grmsPAF2_resids) &gt; 0.05 # large.resid sum(large.resid) [1] 57 round(sum(large.resid)/nrow(grmsPAF2_resids), 3) [1] 0.19 We learn that there are 57 residuals greater than the absolute value of 0.05. This represents 19% of the total number of residuals. There are no hard rules about what proportion of residuals can be greater than 0.05. Field recommends that it stay below 50% (Field, 2012). Another approach to analyzing residuals is to look at their mean. Because of the +/- valences, we need to square them (to eliminate the negative), take the average, then take the square root. round(sqrt(mean(grmsPAF2_resids^2)), 3) [1] 0.036 While there are no clear guidelines to interpret these, one recommendation is to consider extracting more factors if the value is higher than 0.08 (Field, 2012). Finally, we expect our residuals to be normally distributed. A histogram can help us inspect the distribution. hist(grmsPAF2_resids) Not bad! It looks reasonably normal. No outliers. 9.5.2.2 Quick recap of how to evaluate the # of factors we extracted If fewer than 30 variables, the eigenvalue &gt; 1 (Kaiser’s) critera is fine, so long as communalities are all &gt; .70. If sample size &gt; 250 and the average communalities are .6 or greater, this is acceptable When N &gt; 200, the scree plot can be used. Regarding residuals: Fewer than 50% should have absolute values &gt; 0.05. Model fit should be &gt; 0.90. 9.5.3 Factor Rotation Here’s a snip of our location in the PAF workflow. Image of our location in the PAF workflow The original solution of a principal components or principal axis factor analysis is a set of vectors that best account for the observed covariance or correlation matrix. Each additional component or factor accounts for progressively less and less variance. The solution is efficient (yay) but difficult to interpret (boo). Thanks to Thurstone’s five rules toward a simple structure (circa 1947), interpretation of a matrix is facilitaed by rotation (multiplying a matrix by a matrix of orthogonal vectors that preserve the communalities of each variable). Both the original matrix and the solution will be orthogonal. Parsimony becomes a statistical consideration (an equation, in fact) and goal and is maximized when each variable has a 1.0 loading on one factor and the rest are zero. Different rotation strategies emphasize different goals related to parsimony: Quartimax seeks to maximize the notion of variable parsimony (each variable is associated with one factor) and permits the rotation toward a general factor (ignoring smaller factors). Varimax maximizes the variance of squared loadings taken over items instead of over factors and avoids a general factor. Rotation improves the interpretation of the factor by maximizing the loading on each variable on one of the extracted factors while minimizing the loading on all other factors. Rotation works by changing the absolute values of the variables while keeping their differential values constant. There are two big choices (to be made on theoretical grounds): Orthogonal rotation if you think that the factors are independent/unrelated. varimax is the most common orthogonal rotation Oblique rotation if you think that the factors are related/correlated. oblimin and promax are common oblique rotations 9.5.3.1 Orthogonal rotation # grmsPAF2ORTH &lt;- psych::fa(GRMSr, nfactors = 4, fm = &#39;pa&#39;, rotate = # &#39;varimax&#39;) grmsPAF2ORTH &lt;- psych::fa(dfGRMS, nfactors = 4, fm = &quot;pa&quot;, rotate = &quot;varimax&quot;) grmsPAF2ORTH Factor Analysis using method = pa Call: psych::fa(r = dfGRMS, nfactors = 4, rotate = &quot;varimax&quot;, fm = &quot;pa&quot;) Standardized loadings (pattern matrix) based upon correlation matrix PA1 PA2 PA3 PA4 h2 u2 com Obj1 0.49 0.14 0.16 0.04 0.29 0.71 1.4 Obj2 0.51 0.18 0.13 0.09 0.32 0.68 1.4 Obj3 0.45 0.14 0.15 0.07 0.25 0.75 1.5 Obj4 0.54 0.19 0.04 0.03 0.33 0.67 1.3 Obj5 0.47 0.15 0.19 -0.02 0.28 0.72 1.6 Obj6 0.39 0.05 0.06 0.26 0.22 0.78 1.8 Obj7 0.41 0.27 0.16 0.10 0.27 0.73 2.2 Obj8 0.52 0.23 0.03 -0.18 0.35 0.65 1.7 Obj9 0.38 0.07 0.19 -0.01 0.19 0.81 1.5 Obj10 0.44 0.06 0.06 0.12 0.22 0.78 1.2 Marg1 0.13 0.77 0.08 0.02 0.62 0.38 1.1 Marg2 0.13 0.53 0.30 0.15 0.41 0.59 1.9 Marg3 0.18 0.46 0.16 0.08 0.28 0.72 1.6 Marg4 0.26 0.45 -0.01 0.13 0.28 0.72 1.8 Marg5 0.23 0.49 0.16 0.07 0.33 0.67 1.7 Marg6 0.35 0.35 0.08 0.16 0.27 0.73 2.5 Marg7 0.14 0.38 0.07 0.10 0.18 0.82 1.5 Str1 0.16 0.16 0.55 -0.08 0.36 0.64 1.4 Str2 0.24 0.09 0.30 0.16 0.18 0.82 2.7 Str3 0.07 0.07 0.51 0.06 0.28 0.72 1.1 Str4 0.14 0.04 0.38 -0.03 0.17 0.83 1.3 Str5 0.11 0.09 0.36 0.16 0.18 0.82 1.8 Ang1 0.02 0.18 0.35 0.25 0.22 0.78 2.4 Ang2 0.05 0.20 0.06 0.62 0.43 0.57 1.2 Ang3 0.10 0.26 0.15 0.31 0.19 0.81 2.7 PA1 PA2 PA3 PA4 SS loadings 2.60 2.26 1.41 0.83 Proportion Var 0.10 0.09 0.06 0.03 Cumulative Var 0.10 0.19 0.25 0.28 Proportion Explained 0.37 0.32 0.20 0.12 Cumulative Proportion 0.37 0.68 0.88 1.00 Mean item complexity = 1.7 Test of the hypothesis that 4 factors are sufficient. df null model = 300 with the objective function = 4.89 with Chi Square = 1217.51 df of the model are 206 and the objective function was 0.77 The root mean square of the residuals (RMSR) is 0.04 The df corrected root mean square of the residuals is 0.04 The harmonic n.obs is 259 with the empirical chi square 202.41 with prob &lt; 0.56 The total n.obs was 259 with Likelihood Chi Square = 189.19 with prob &lt; 0.79 Tucker Lewis Index of factoring reliability = 1.027 RMSEA index = 0 and the 90 % confidence intervals are 0 0.018 BIC = -955.52 Fit based upon off diagonal values = 0.97 Measures of factor score adequacy PA1 PA2 PA3 PA4 Correlation of (regression) scores with factors 0.84 0.85 0.76 0.72 Multiple R square of scores with factors 0.71 0.72 0.58 0.52 Minimum correlation of possible factor scores 0.42 0.45 0.17 0.03 Essentially, we have the same information as before, except that loadings are calculated after rotation (which adjusts the absolute values of the factor loadings while keeping their differential vales constant).

After rotation, there are four clear factors/scales. Further, there is clear (or at least reasonable) factor/scale membership for each item and few cross-loadings. As with the PAC in the previous lesson, Ang1 is not clearly loading on the Angry scale. If this were a new scale and we had not yet established ideas for subscales, the next step would be to look back at the items, themselves, and try to name the scales/factors. If our scale construction included a priori/planned subscales, we would hope the items would where they were hypothesized to do so. As we noted with the Ang1 item, our simulated data nearly replicated the item membership onto the four scales that Lewis and Neville (J. A. Lewis &amp; Neville, 2015) reported in the article.

As before, Ang1 is loading onto Strong. Additionally Ang3 has factor loadings that fall below .30, and therefore do not appear in this table. Additionally, because our specification included “sort=TRUE”, the relative weights wiggled around and so the items are listed in a different order than in the orthogonal rotation. The oblique rotation allows us to see the correlation between the factors/scales. This was not available in the orthogonal rotation because the assumption of the orthogonal/varimax rotation is that the scales/factors are uncorrelated; hence in the analysis they were fixed to 0.0. The correlations from our simulated data range from .19 to .46. Of course there is always a little complexity. In oblique rotations, there is a distinction between the pattern matrix (which reports factor loadings and is comparable to the matrix we interpreted for the orthogonal rotation) and the structure matrix (takes into account the relationship between the factors/scales – it is a product of the pattern matrix and the matrix containing the correlation coefficients between the factors/scales). Most interpret the pattern matrix because it is simpler; however it could be that values in the pattern matrix are suppressed because of relations between the factors. Therefore, the structure matrix can be a useful check and some editors will request it. Obtaining the structure matrix requires two steps. First, multiply the factor loadings with the phi matrix. grmsPAF2obl$loadings %*% grmsPAF2obl$Phi PA1 PA2 PA3 PA4 Obj1 0.5351558 0.2587471 0.2578729 0.10672133 Obj2 0.5596959 0.2939415 0.2397101 0.15920737 Obj3 0.4931574 0.2456837 0.2386994 0.13178696 Obj4 0.5676937 0.2946510 0.1536862 0.09619880 Obj5 0.5143469 0.2639663 0.2797209 0.05320390 Obj6 0.4083011 0.1433380 0.1363673 0.28476763 Obj7 0.4891359 0.3627793 0.2697523 0.18376868 Obj8 0.5462750 0.3181931 0.1337799 -0.09863944 Obj9 0.4098436 0.1673842 0.2524221 0.04306615 Obj10 0.4526040 0.1614974 0.1403757 0.15874466 Marg1 0.3385023 0.7854134 0.2197285 0.18936979 Marg2 0.3164379 0.5904981 0.3994360 0.29125182 Marg3 0.3190254 0.5084002 0.2613340 0.19797897 Marg4 0.3686089 0.4872840 0.1082789 0.22714662 Marg5 0.3780702 0.5477661 0.2747713 0.19177240 Marg6 0.4417130 0.4228182 0.1911285 0.24703507 Marg7 0.2525475 0.4115888 0.1520707 0.19123240 Str1 0.2752766 0.2583504 0.5843472 0.02598261 Str2 0.3031342 0.1787399 0.3515298 0.21686734 Str3 0.1645811 0.1543190 0.5235449 0.13423477 Str4 0.1999438 0.1116093 0.3967457 0.02531912 Str5 0.1976930 0.1656974 0.3929920 0.21880162 Ang1 0.1344340 0.2417716 0.3896315 0.32188168 Ang2 0.1467619 0.2423578 0.1284210 0.65279494 Ang3 0.2088530 0.3073000 0.2225652 0.37115411 Next, use Field’s (2012) function to produce the matrix. # Field&#39;s function to produce the structure matrix factor.structure &lt;- function(fa, cut = 0.2, decimals = 2) { structure.matrix &lt;- psych::fa.sort(fa$loadings %*% fa$Phi) structure.matrix &lt;- data.frame(ifelse(abs(structure.matrix) &lt; cut, &quot;&quot;, round(structure.matrix, decimals))) return(structure.matrix) } factor.structure(grmsPAF2obl, cut = 0.3) PA1 PA2 PA3 PA4 Obj4 0.57 Obj2 0.56 Obj8 0.55 0.32 Obj1 0.54 Obj5 0.51 Obj3 0.49 Obj7 0.49 0.36 Obj10 0.45 Marg6 0.44 0.42 Obj9 0.41 Obj6 0.41 Marg1 0.34 0.79 Marg2 0.32 0.59 0.4 Marg5 0.38 0.55 Marg3 0.32 0.51 Marg4 0.37 0.49 Marg7 0.41 Str1 0.58 Str3 0.52 Str4 0.4 Str5 0.39 Ang1 0.39 0.32 Str2 0.3 0.35 Ang2 0.65 Ang3 0.31 0.37 Here we see some instability.

These can be used to assess the relative standing of one person on the construct/variable to another. We can also use them in regression (in place of means or sums) when groups of predictors correlate so highly that there is multicolliearity. Computation involves multiplying an individual’s item-level response by the factor loadings we obtained through the PAF process.

First, data screening were conducted to determine the suitability of the data for this analyses. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy (KMO; Kaiser, 1970) represents the ratio of the squared correlation between variables to the squared partial correlation between variables. KMO ranges from 0.00 to 1.00; values closer to 1.00 indicate that the patterns of correlations are relatively compact and that factor analysis should yield distinct and reliable factors (Field, 2012). In our dataset, the KMO value was .85, indicating acceptable sampling adequacy. The Barlett’s Test of Sphericity examines whether the population correlation matrix resembles an identity matrix (Field, 2012). When the p value for the Bartlett’s test is &lt; .05, we are fairly certain we have clusters of correlated variables. In our dataset, \\(\\chi^{2}(300)=1217.508, p &lt; .001\\), indicating the correlations between items are sufficiently large enough for principal factor analysis. The determinant of the correlation matrix alerts us to any issues of multicollinearity or singularity and should be larger than 0.00001. Our determinant was 0.0075, supporting the suitability of our data for analysis. Four criteria were used to determine the number of factors to rotate: a priori theory, the scree test, the Eigenvalue-greater-than-one criteria, and the interpretability of the solution. Kaiser’s eigenvalue-greater-than-one criteria suggested two factors, and, in combination explained 28% of the variance. The scree plot was showed an inflexion that would justified retaining between one and four factors. A priori theory based on Lewis and Neville’s (2015) psychometric evaluation, suggested four factors. Based on the convergence of these decisions, four factors were extracted. We investigated each with orthogonal (varimax) and oblique (oblimin) procedures. Given the correspondence of the orthogonal solution with the original research, we selected this as our final model. The rotated solution, as shown in Table 1 and Figure 1, yielded four interpretable factors, each listed with the proportion of variance accounted for: assumptions of beauty and sexual objectification (10%), silenced and marginalized (9%), strong woman stereotype (6%), and angry woman stereotype (3%). Regarding the Table 1, I would include a table with all the values, bolding those with factor membership. This will be easy because we exported all those values to a .csv file. 9.6.1 Comparing FA and PCA FA derives a mathematical solution from which factors are estimated. Only FA can estimate underlying factors, but it relies on the various assumptions to be met. PCA decomposes the original data into a set of linear variates. This limits its concern to establishing which linear components exist within the data and how a particular variable might contribute to that component. Generally, FA and PCA result in similar solutions. When there are 30 or more variables and communalities are &gt; .7 for all variables, different solutions are unlikely (Stevens, 2002). When there are &lt; 20 variables and low communalities (&lt; .4) different solutions are likely to emerge. Both are inferential statistics. Critics of PCA suggest “At best it is a common factor analysis with some error added and at worst an unrecognizable hodgepodge of things from which nothing can be determined” (Cliff, 1987, p. 349). PCA should never be described as FA and the resulting components should not be treated as reverently as true, latent variable, factors. To most of us (i.e., scientist-practitioners), the difference is largely from the algorithm used to derive the solutions. This is true for Field (Field, 2012) also, who uses the terms interchangeably. My take: use whichever you like, just be precise in the language describing what you did. 9.7 Going Back to the Future: What, then, is Omega? Now that we’ve had an introduction to factor analysis, let’s revisit the \\(\\omega\\) grouping of reliability estimates. In the context of psychometrics, it may be useful to think of factors as scales/subscales where g refers to the amount of variance in the general factor (or total scale score) and subcales to be items that have something in common that is separate from what is g. Model-based estimates examine the correlations or covariances of the items and decompose the test variance into that which is: common to all items (g, a general factor), specific to some items (f, orthogonal group factors), and unique to each item (confounding s specific, and e error variance) In the psych package \\(\\omega_{t}\\) represents the total reliability of the test (\\(\\omega_{t}\\)). In the psych package, this is calculated from a bifactor model where there is one general g factor (i.e., each item loads on the single general factor), one or more group factors (f), and an item-specific factor (s). \\(\\omega_{h}\\) extracts a higher order factor from the correlation matrix of lower level factors, then applies the Schmid and Leiman (1957) transformation to find the general loadings on the original items. Stated another way, it is a measure o f the general factor saturation (g; the amount of variance attributable to one comon factor). The subscript “h” acknowledges the hierarchical nature of the approach. the \\(\\omega_{h}\\) approach is exploratory and defined if there are three or more group factors (with only two group factors, the default is to assume they are equally important, hence the factor loadings of those subscales will be equal) Najera Catalan (Najera Catalan, 2019) suggests that \\(\\omega_{h}\\) is the best measure of reliability when dealing with multiple dimensions. \\(\\omega_{g}\\) is an estimate that uses a bifactor solution via the SEM package lavaan and tends to be a larger (because it forces all the cross loadings of lower level factors to be 0) \\(\\omega_{g}\\) is confirmatory, requiring the specification of which variables load on each group factor psych::omegaSem() reports both EFA and CFA solutions We will use the psych::omegaSem() function. Note that in our specification, we indicate there are two factors. We do not tell it (anywhere!) what items belong to what factors (think, subscales). One test will be to see if the items align with their respective factors. # Because we added the factor scores to our df (and now it has more # variables than just our items), I will estimate omegaSem with the # correlation matrix; I will need to tell it the n.obs psych::omegaSem(GRMSr, nfactors = 4, n.obs = 259) Warning in lav_model_vcov(lavmodel = lavmodel, lavsamplestats = lavsamplestats, : lavaan WARNING: Could not compute standard errors!

How do we make sense of it? First, excepting for the Angry scale (noted before), our items aligned reasonably with their respective factors (subscales). Second, we can interpret our results. Like alpha, the omegas range from 0 to 1, where values closer to 1 represent good reliability (Najera Catalan, 2019). For unidimensional measures, \\(\\omega_{t}\\) values above 0.80 seem to be an indicator of good reliability. For multidimensional measures with well-defined dimensions we strive for \\(\\omega_{h}\\) values above 0.65 (and \\(\\omega_{t}\\) &gt; 0.8). These recommendations are based on a Monte Carlo study that examined a host of reliability indicators and how their values corresponded with accurate predictions of poverty status. With this in mind, let’s examine the output related to our simulated research vignette. Let’s examine the output in the lower portion where the values are “from a confirmatory model using sem.” Omega is a reliability estimate for factor analysis that represents the proportion of variance in the GRMS scale attributable to common variance (rather than error). The omega for the total reliability of the test (\\(\\omega_{t}\\); which included the general factors and the subscale factors) was .86, meaning that 86% of the variance in the total scale is due to the factors and 14% (100% - 86%) is attributable to error. Omega hierarchical (\\(\\omega_{h}\\)) estimates are the proportion of variance in the GRMS score attributable to the general factor, which in effect treats the subscales as error. \\(\\omega_{h}\\) for the the GRMS total scale was .70 A quick calculation with \\(\\omega_{h}\\) (.70) and \\(\\omega_{t}\\) (.86; .70/.86 = .81) lets us know that that 81% of the reliable variance in the GRMS total scale is attributable to the general factor. .70/.86 [1] 0.8139535 Amongst the output is the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient (.84). Lewis and Neville (2015) did not report omega results. They reported an alpha of .92 for the version of the GRMS that assessed stress appraisal. 9.8 Comparing PFA to Item Analysis and PCA In the lesson on PCA, we began a table that compared our item analysis (item corrected-total correlations with item-other scale correlations) and PCA results (both orthogonal and oblique). Let’s now add our PAF results (both orthogonal and oblique). In the prior lecture, I saved the file as both .rds and .csv objects. I will bring back in the .rds object and add to it.

The results were consistent across the analyses, pointing only to problems with the Angry scale. Please note that the problems were with my simulated data and not the original data. Comparison of path models for PCA and EFA 9.9 Practice Problems In each of these lessons I provide suggestions for practice that allow you to select one or more problems that are graded in difficulty. In psychometrics, I strongly recommend that you have started with a dataset that has a minimum of three subscales and use it for all of the assignments in the OER. In any case, please plan to: Properly format and prepare the data. Conduct diagnostic tests to determine the suitability of the data for PAF Conduct tests to guide the decisions about number of factors to extract. Conduct orthogonal and oblique rotations (at least two each with different numbers of factor). Select one solution and preparing an APA style results section (with table and figure). Compare your results in light of any other psychometrics lessons where you have used this data (especially the item analysis and PCA lessons). 9.9.1 Problem #1: Play around with this simulation. Copy the script for the simulation and then change (at least) one thing in the simulation to see how it impacts the results. If PAF is new to you, perhaps you just change the number in “set.seed(240311)” from 240311 to something else. Your results should parallel those obtained in the lecture, making it easier for you to check your work as you go. Don’t be surprised if the factor loadings wiggle around a little. Do try to make sense of them. 9.9.2 Problem #2: Conduct a PAF with another simulated set of data in the OER. The second option involves utilizing one of the simulated datasets available in this OER. The last lesson in the OER contains three simulations that could be used for all of the statistics-based practice suggestions. Especially if you started with one of these examples in an earlier lesson, I highly recommend you continue with that. Alternatively, Keum et al.’s Gendered Racial Microaggressions Scale for Asian American Women (Keum et al., 2018) will be used in the lessons on confirmatory factor analysis and Conover et al.’s (Conover et al., 2017) Ableist Microaggressions Scale is used in the lesson on invariance testing. Both of these would be suitable for the PCA and PAF homework assignments. 9.9.3 Problem #3: Try something entirely new. Using data for which you have permission and access (e.g., IRB approved data you have collected or from your lab; data you simulate from a published article; data from the ReCentering Psych Stats survey described in the Qualtrics lesson, or data from an open science repository), complete a PAF analysis. The data should allow for at least three factors/subscales. 9.9.4 Grading Rubric Using the lecture and workflow (chart) as a guide, please work through all the steps listed in the proposed assignment/grading rubric.

As a brief review, this data is part of an IRB-approved study, with consent to use in teaching demonstrations and to be made available to the general public via the open science framework. Hence, it is appropriate to use in this context. You will notice there are student- and teacher- IDs. These numbers are not actual student and teacher IDs, rather they were further re-identified so that they could not be connected to actual people. Because this is an actual dataset, if you wish to work the problem along with me, you will need to download the ReC.rds data file from the Worked_Examples folder in the ReC_Psychometrics project on the GitHub. The course evaluation items can be divided into three subscales: Valued by the student includes the items: ValObjectives, IncrUnderstanding, IncrInterest Traditional pedagogy includes the items: ClearResponsibilities, EffectiveAnswers, Feedback, ClearOrganization, ClearPresentation Socially responsive pedagogy includes the items: InclusvClassrm, EquitableEval, MultPerspectives, DEIintegration In this homewoRked example I will conduct a principal components analysis. My hope is that the results will support my solution of three dimensions: valued-by-the-student, traditional pedagogy, socially responsive pedagogy. 9.10.1 Check and, if needed, format data big &lt;- readRDS(&quot;ReC.rds&quot;) With the next code I will create an item-level df with only the items used in the three scales. library(tidyverse) items &lt;- big %&gt;% dplyr::select(ValObjectives, IncrUnderstanding, IncrInterest, ClearResponsibilities, EffectiveAnswers, Feedback, ClearOrganization, ClearPresentation, MultPerspectives, InclusvClassrm, DEIintegration, EquitableEval) Some of the analyses require non-missing data in the df. items &lt;- na.omit(items) Let’s check the structure of the data. str(items) Classes &#39;data.table&#39; and &#39;data.frame&#39;: 267 obs. of 12 variables: $ ValObjectives : int 5 5 4 4 5 5 5 4 5 3 ... $ IncrUnderstanding : int 2 3 4 3 4 5 2 4 5 4 ... $ IncrInterest : int 5 3 4 2 4 5 3 2 5 1 ... $ ClearResponsibilities: int 5 5 4 4 5 5 4 4 5 3 ... $ EffectiveAnswers : int 5 3 5 3 5 4 3 2 3 3 ... $ Feedback : int 5 3 4 2 5 5 4 4 5 2 ... $ ClearOrganization : int 3 4 3 4 4 5 4 4 5 2 ... $ ClearPresentation : int 4 4 4 2 5 4 4 4 5 2 ... $ MultPerspectives : int 5 5 4 5 5 5 5 5 5 1 ... $ InclusvClassrm : int 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 4 5 3 ... $ DEIintegration : int 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 ... $ EquitableEval : int 5 5 3 5 5 5 5 3 5 3 ... - attr(*, &quot;.internal.selfref&quot;)=&lt;externalptr&gt; - attr(*, &quot;na.action&quot;)= &#39;omit&#39; Named int [1:43] 6 20 106 109 112 113 114 117 122 128 ... ..- attr(*, &quot;names&quot;)= chr [1:43] &quot;6&quot; &quot;20&quot; &quot;106&quot; &quot;109&quot; ... 9.10.2 Conduct and interpret the three diagnostic tests to determine if PAF is appropriate as an analysis (KMO, Bartlett’s, determinant) 9.10.2.1 KMO The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) index is an index of sampling adequacy to let us know if the sample size is sufficient relative to the statistical characteristics of the data. General crieria (1974, Kaiser): bare minimum of .5 values between .5 and .7 as mediocre values above .9 are superb psych::KMO(items) Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin factor adequacy Call: psych::KMO(r = items) Overall MSA = 0.91 MSA for each item = ValObjectives IncrUnderstanding IncrInterest 0.94 0.89 0.89 ClearResponsibilities EffectiveAnswers Feedback 0.91 0.93 0.94 ClearOrganization ClearPresentation MultPerspectives 0.94 0.91 0.93 InclusvClassrm DEIintegration EquitableEval 0.86 0.78 0.95 With a KMO of 0.91, the data seems appropriate to continue with the PCA. 9.10.2.2 Bartlett’s Barlett’s test let’s us know if the matrix is an identity matrix (i.e., where elements on the off-diagonal would be 0.0 and elements on the diagonal would be 1.0). Stated another way – items only correlate with “themselves” and not other variables. When \\(p &lt; 0.05\\) the matrix is not an identity matrix. That is, there are some relationships between variables that can be analyzed. psych::cortest.bartlett(items) R was not square, finding R from data $chisq [1] 1897.769 $p.value [1] 0 $df [1] 66 The Barlett’s test, \\(\\chi^2(66) = 1897.77, p &lt; 0.001\\), indicating that the correlation matrix is not an identity matrix and, on that dimension, is suitable for analysis. 9.10.2.3 Determinant Multicollinearity or singularity is diagnosed by the determinant. The determinant should be greater than 0.00001. If smaller, then there may be an issue with multicollinearity (variables that are too highly correlated) or singularity (variables that are perfectly correlated). items &lt;- na.omit(items) det(cor(items)) [1] 0.0006985496 The value of the determinant is 0.0007; greater than 0.00001. We are not concerned with multicollinearity or singularity. Summary from data screening: Data screening were conducted to determine the suitability of the data for principal axis factoring. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy (KMO; Kaiser, 1970) represents the ratio of the squared correlation between variables to the squared partial correlation between variables. KMO ranges from 0.00 to 1.00; values closer to 1.00 indicate that the patterns of correlations are relatively compact and that component analysis should yield distinct and reliable components (Field, 2012). In our dataset, the KMO value was 0.91, indicating acceptable sampling adequacy. The Barlett’s Test of Sphericity examines whether the population correlation matrix resembles an identity matrix (Field, 2012). When the p value for the Bartlett’s test is &lt; .05, we are fairly certain we have clusters of correlated variables. In our dataset, \\(\\chi^2(66) = 1897.77, p &lt; 0.001\\) indicating the correlations between items are sufficiently large enough for principal components analysis. The determinant of the correlation matrix alerts us to any issues of multicollinearity or singularity and should be larger than 0.00001. Our determinant was 0.0007 and, again, indicated that our data was suitable for the analysis. 9.10.3 Determine how many components to extract (e.g., scree plot, eigenvalues, theory) Specify fewer factors than number of items (12).

In the lecture I made a “biggish deal” about PCA being components analysis and PAF being factor analysis. Although the two approaches can lead to similar results/conclusions, there are some significant differences “under the hood.” PCA can be thought of more as regression where the items predict the component. Consequently, the arrows went from the item, to the component. In PAF, the arrows will go from the factor to the item – because the factors (or latent variables) are assumed to predict the scores on the items (i.e., “depression” would predict how someone rates items that assess hopelessness, sleep, anhedonia, and so forth).

These are high. Therefore, I will choose a 3-factor, oblique, solution. 9.10.7 APA style results section with table and figure of one of the solutions The dimensionality of the 12 course evaluation items was analyzed using principal axis factoring (PAF). First, data were screened to determine the suitability of the data for this analyses. Data screening were conducted to determine the suitability of the data for this analyses. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy (KMO; Kaiser, 1970) represents the ratio of the squared correlation between variables to the squared partial correlation between variables. KMO ranges from 0.00 to 1.00; values closer to 1.00 indicate that the patterns of correlations are relatively compact and that component analysis should yield distinct and reliable components (Field, 2012). In our dataset, the KMO value was 0.91, indicating acceptable sampling adequacy. The Barlett’s Test of Sphericity examines whether the population correlation matrix resembles an identity matrix (Field, 2012). When the p value for the Bartlett’s test is &lt; .05, we are fairly certain we have clusters of correlated variables. In our dataset, \\(\\chi^2(66) = 1897.77, p &lt; 0.001\\) indicating the correlations between items are sufficiently large enough for principal components analysis. The determinant of the correlation matrix alerts us to any issues of multicollinearity or singularity and should be larger than 0.00001. Our determinant was 0.0007 and, again, indicated that our data was suitable for the analysis. Four criteria were used to determine the number of components to extract: a priori theory, the scree test, the eigenvalue-greater-than-one criteria, and the interpretability of the solution. Kaiser’s eigenvalue-greater-than-one criteria suggested one component and explained 51% of the variance. The inflexion in the scree plot justified retaining one to three components. A priorily, we researchers were expecting three factors – which would explain 63% of the variance. Correspondingly, we investigated two and three factor solutions with orthogonal (varimax) and oblique (oblimin) procedures. Given the significant correlations (ranging from .31 to .65) and the correspondence of items loading on the a priorili hypothesized components, we determined that an oblique, three-factor, solution was most appropriate. The rotated solution, as shown in Table 1 and Figure 1, yielded three interpretable factors, each listed with the proportion of variance accounted for: traditional pedagogy (32%), valued-by-me (18%), and socially and culturally responsive pedagogy (13%). Regarding the Table 1, I would include a table with ALL the values, bolding those with component membership.

We will specify, run, and interpret first order models that are unidimensional and multidimensional. We will compare models to each other and identify key issues in model specification. 10.1 Navigating this Lesson This lesson is just over two hours. I would add another two hours to work through and digest the materials. While the majority of R objects and data you will need are created within the R script that sources the chapter, occasionally there are some that cannot be created from within the R framework. Additionally, sometimes links fail. All original materials are provided at the Github site that hosts the book. More detailed guidelines for ways to access all these materials are provided in the OER’s introduction. 10.1.1 Learning Objectives Focusing on this week’s materials, make sure you can: Compare and contrast EFA and CFA. Identify the components of item-level variance in CFA. Specify CFA measurement models. Interpret fit indices (e.g., Chi-square, CFI, RMSEA). Interpret statistics used do compare two CFA models. 10.1.2 Planning for Practice In each of these lessons I provide suggestions for practice that allow you to select one or more problems that are graded in difficulty. The least complex is to change the random seed in the research and rework the problem demonstrated in the lesson. The results should map onto the ones obtained in the lecture. The second option involves utilizing one of the simulated datasets available in this OER. The last lesson in the OER contains three simulations that could be used for all of the statistics-based practice suggestions. Especially if you started with one of these examples in an earlier lesson, I highly recommend you continue with that. Alternatively, Lewis and Neville’s (2015) Gendered Racial Microaggressions Scale for Black Women was used in the lessons for exploratory factor analysis and Conover et al.’s (2017) Ableist Microaggressions Scale is used in the lesson on invariance testing. Both of these would be suitable for the CFA homework assignments. As a third option, you are welcome to use data to which you have access and is suitable for CFA. This could include other simulated data, data found on an open access repository, data from the ReCentering Psych Stats survey described in the Qualtrics lesson, or your own data (presuming you have permission to use it). The suggestion for practice spans this chapter and the next. From this assignment, you should plan to: Prepare the data frame for CFA. Specify and run unidimensional and single order (with correlated factors) models. In the next chapter, you will add the specification, evaluation, and write-up of second-order and bifactor models.

When we assume that variance is 1.0, the common variance becomes the communality. If we have 8 items, we will have 8 communalities and this represents the common variance explained by the factors or components. Common variance is shared among the indicators and serves as a basis for observed covariances among them that depart, meaningfully, from zero. We generally assume that: Common variance is due to the factors. There will be fewer factors than the number of indicators/items. After all, there is no point in retaining as many factors [explanatory entities] as there are entities to be explained [indicators/items]. The proportion of total variance that is shared is the communality (estimated by \\(h^2\\)); if \\(h^2\\) =.70, then 70% of the total indicator variance is common and potentially explained by the factors. Unique variance consists of specific variance systematic variance that is not explained by any factor in the model, random measurement error, method variance which is not represented in the figure, but could be another source of unique variance. In factor analysis, summing the communalities represents the total common variance (a portion of the total variance), but not the total variance. Factor analysis, then, aligns well with classic test theory and classic approaches to understanding reliability (observed score = true score + error). The inclusion of error is illustrated well in the classic illustrations of CFA and SEM where each item/indicator includes common variance (from the factor) and error variance. Recall that in principal components analysis (PCA is not factor analysis) one of the key distinctions is that all variance is common variance (there is no unique variance). Total common variance is equal to the total variance explained, which in turn is equal to the total variance. Figure illustrating the unique and common variance associated with a factor 10.2.2 Differences between EFA and CFA Below are contrasts between exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. A priori specification of the number of factors EFA requires no a priori specification; prior to extraction an EFA program will extract as many factors as indicators. Typically, in subsequent analyses, the researchers specifies how many factors to extract. CFA requires researchers to specify the exact number of factors. The degree of “exact correspondence” between indicators/items and factors/scales EFA is an unrestricted measurement model That is, indicators/items depend on (theoretically, measure) all factors. The direct effects from factors to indicators are pattern coefficients. Kline (2016) says that most refer to these as factor loadings or just loadings but because he believes these terms are ambiguous, he refers to the direct effects as pattern coefficients. We assign them to factors based on their highest loadings (and hopefully no cross-loadings). Depending on whether we select an orthogonal or oblique relationship, correlations between factors will be permitted or suppressed. CFA is a restricted measurement model. The researcher specifies the factor(s) on which each indicator/item(s) depends (recall, the causal direction in CFA is from factor to indicators/items.) Identification status: The identification of a model has to do with whether it is theoretically possible for a statistics package to derive a unique set of model parameter estimates. Identification is related to model degrees of freedom; we will later explore under-, just-, and over-identified models. For now: EFA models with multiple factors are unidentified because they will have more free parameters than observations. Thus, there is no unique set of statistical estimates for the multifactor EFA model, consequently this requires the rotation phase in EFA. CFA models must be identified before they can be analyzed so there is only one unique set of parameter estimates. Correspondingly, there is no rotation phase in CFA. Sharing variances In EFA the specific variance of each indicator is not shared with that of any other indicator. In CFA, the researchers can specify if variance is shared between certain pairs of indicators (i.e., error covariances). 10.2.3 On the relationship between EFA and CFA Kline (2016) admonishes us to not overinterpret the labels “exploratory” and “confirmatory”. Why? EFA requires no a priori hypotheses about the relationship between indicators/items and factors, but researchers often expect to specify a predetermined number of factors. CFA is not strictly confirmatory. After initial runs, many researchers modify models and hypotheses. CFA is not a verification or confirmation of EFA results for the same data and number of factors. Kline (2016) does not recommend that researchers follow a model retained from EFA. Why? It is possible that the CFA model will be rejected. Oftentimes this is because the secondary coefficients (i.e., non-primary pattern coefficients) accounted for a signifciant proportion of variance in the model. When they are constrained to 0.0 in the CFA model, the model fit will suffer. If the CFA model is retained, then it is possible that both EFA and CFA capitalized on chance variation. Thus, if verification via CFA is desired, it should be evaluated through a replication sample. 10.3 Exploring a Standard CFA Model The research vignette for today is a fairly standard CFA model. Image of the GRMSAAW represented as a standard CFA model The image represents represents the hypothesis that \\(AS_1 - AS_9\\), \\(AF_1 - AF_4\\), \\(MI_1 - MI_5\\), and \\(AUA_1 - AUA_4\\) measure, respectively, the AS, AF, MI, and AUA factors, which are assumed to covary. Specifically,in this model: Each indicator is continuous with two causes: \\(AS\\) –&gt; \\(AS_1\\) &lt;– \\(E_1\\) a single factor that the indicator is supposed to measure, and all unique sources of influence represented by the error term The error terms are independent of each other and of the factors All associations are linear and the factors covary. Hence, the symbol for an unanalyzed association is a solid line. Each item has a single pattern coefficient (i.e., often more casually termed as a “factor loading”) All other potential pattern coefficients are set to “0.00.” These are hard hypotheses and are specified by their absence (i.e., not specified in the code or in the diagram). Structure coefficients are the Pearson correlations between factors and continuous indicators. They reflect any source of association, causal or non causal. Sometimes the association is an undirected, back-door path. There is no pattern coefficient for \\(AS_2\\) &lt;-&gt; \\(AF\\). BUT, there is a connection from \\(AS_2\\) to \\(AF\\) via the \\(AS\\) &lt;–&gt; \\(AF\\) covariance. Scaling constants (aka unit loading identification [ULI] constraints) are necessary to scale the factors in a metric related to that of the explained (common) variance of the corresponding indicator, or reference (marker) variable. In the figure these are the dashed-line paths from \\(AS\\) –&gt; \\(AS_1\\), \\(AF\\) –&gt; \\(AF1\\), \\(MI\\) –&gt; \\(MI1\\) and \\(AUA\\) –&gt; \\(AUA1\\). Selecting the reference marker variable is usually arbitrary and selected by the computer program as the first (or last) variable in the code/path. So long as all the indicator variables of the same factor have equally reliable scores, this works satisfactorily. Additional scaling constants are found for each of the errors and indicators. 10.3.1 Model Identification for CFA SEM, in general, requires that all models be identified. Measurement models analyzed in CFA share this requirement, but identification is more straightforward than in other models. Standard CFA models are sufficiently identified when: A single factor model has at least three indicators. In a model with two or more factors, each factor has two or more indicators.There are some caveats and arguments: Some recommend at least three to five indicators per factor to prevent technical problems with statistical identification. In a recent SEM workshop, Todd Little indicated that optimal fit will occur when factors are just-identified with three items per factor. Of course, three factors may be insufficient to represent the construct definition. Identification becomes much more complicated than this, but for today’s models this instruction is sufficent. 10.3.2 Selecting Indicators/Items for a Reflective Measurement Reflective measurement is another term to describe the circumstance where latent variables are assumed to cause observed variables. Observed variables in reflective measurement are called effect (reflective) indicators. At least three for a unidimensional model; at least two per factor for a multidimensional model (but more is safer). The items/indicators should have reasonable internal consistency and correlate with each other. If the scale is multidimensional (i.e., with subscales) items should correlate more highly with other items in their factors than with items on other factors. Negative correlations reduce the reliability of factor measurement, so they should be reverse coded pior to analysis. Do not be tempted to specify a factor with indicators that do not measure something. A common mistake is to create a “background” factor and include indicators such as gender, ethnicity, and level of education. Just what is the predicted relationship between gender and ethnicity? 10.4 CFA Workflow Below is a screenshot of a CFA workflow. The original document is located in the Github site that hosts the ReCentering Psych Stats: Psychometrics OER. Image of a workflow for specifying and evaluating a confirmatory factor analytic model Because the intended audience for the ReCentering Psych Stats OER is the scientist-practitioner-advocate, this lesson focuses on the workflow and decisions in straightforward CFA models. As you might guess, the details of CFA can be quite complex and require more investigation and decision-making in models that pose more complexity or empirical challenges. The following are the general steps in a CFA. Creating an items-only dataframe where any items are scaled in the same direction (e.g., negatively worded items are reverse-scored). Determining a factor structure that is identified. A single factor (unidimensional) model has at least three items/indicators. Multidimensional models have at least two items per factor. Specify a series of models, these typicallyinclude: a unidimensional model (all items on a single factor), a single order structure with correlated factors, a second orer structure, a bifactor structure. Evaluate model fit with a variety of indicators, including: factor loadings, fit indices. Compare models. In the event of poor model fit, investigate modification indices and consider respecification by: eliminating items, changing factor membership, allowing errors to covary. 10.4.1 CFA in lavaan Requires Fluency with the Syntax It’s really just regression tilda (~, is regressed on) is regression operator place DV (y) on left of operator place IVs, separate by + on the right f is a latent variable (LV) Example: y ~ f1 + f2 + x1 + x2 LVs must be defined by their manifest or latent indicators. the special operator (=~, is measured/defined by) is used for this Example: f1 =~ y1 + y2 + y3 Variances and covariances are specified with a double tilde operator (~~, is correlated with) Example of variance: y1 ~~ y1 (the relationship with itself) Example of covariance: y1 ~~ y2 (relationship with another variable) Example of covariance of a factor: f1 ~~ f2 *Intercepts (~ 1) for observed and LVs are simple, intercept-only regression formulas + Example of variable intercept: y1 ~ 1 + Example of factor intercept: f1 ~ 1 A complete lavaan model is a combination of these formula types, enclosed between single quotation models. Readibility of model syntax is improved by: splitting formulas over multiple lines using blank lines within single quote labeling with the hashtag myModel &lt;- ’# regressions y1 + y2 ~ f1 + f2 + x1 + x2 f1 ~ f2 + f3 f2 ~ f3 + x1 + x2 # latent variable definitions f1 =~ y1 + y2 + y3 f2 =~ y4 + y5 + y6 f3 =~ y7 + y8 + y9 + y10 # variances and covariances y1 ~~ y1 y2 ~~ y2 f1 ~~ f2 # intercepts y1 ~ 1 fa ~ 1 10.4.2 Differing Factor Structures All models worked in this lesson are first-order (or single-order) models; in the next lesson we extend to hierarchical and bifactor models. To provide an advanced cognitive organizer, let’s take a look across the models. Image of first order (uncorrelated and correlated, second order, and bifactor structures) Models A and B are first-order models. Note that all factors are on a single plane. Model A is undimensional, each item is influenced by a single common factor and a term that includes systematic and random error. Note that there is only one systematic source of variance for each item and it is from a single source. Model B is often referred to as a “correlated traits” model. Here, the larger construct is separated into distinct-yet-correlated elements. The variance of each item is assumed to be a weighted linear function of two or more common factors. Models C is a second-order factor structure. Rather than merely being correlated, factors are related because they share a common cause. In this model, the second order factor explains why three or more traits are correlated. Note that here is no direct relationship between the item and the target construct. Rather, the relationship between the second-order factor and each item is mediated through the primary factor (yes, an indirect effect!). Model D is a bifactor structure. Here each item loads on a general factor. This general factor (bottom row) reflects what is common among the items and represents the individual differences on the target dimension that a researcher is most interested in. Group factors (top row) are now specified as orthogonal. The group factors represent common factors measured by the items that explain item response variation not accounted for by the general factor. In some research scenarios, the group factors are termed “nuisance” dimensions. That is, that which they have in common interferes with measuring the primary target of interest. 10.5 Research Vignette This lesson’s research vignette emerges from Keum et al’s Gendered Racial Microaggressions Scale for Asian American Women (GRMSAAW; (Keum et al., 2018)). The article reports on two separate studies that comprised the development, refinement, and psychometric evaluation of two, parallel, versions (stress appraisal, frequency) of scale. I simulated data from the final construction of the frequency version as the basis of the lecture. If the scale looks somewhat familiar it is because the authors used the Gendered Racial Microaggressions Scale for Black Women (J. A. Lewis &amp; Neville, 2015) as a model. Keum et al. (2018) reported support for a total scale score (22 items) and four subscales. Below, I list the four subscales, their number of items, and a single example item. At the outset, let me provide a content advisory For those who hold this particular identity (or related identities) the content in the items may be upsetting. In other lessons, I often provide a variable name that gives an indication of the primary content of the item. In the case of the GRMSAAW, I will simply provide an abbreviation of the subscale name and its respective item number. This will allow us to easily inspect the alignment of the item with its intended factor, and hopefully minimize discomfort. If you are not a member of this particular identity, I encourage you to learn about these microaggressions by reading the article in its entirety. Please do not ask members of this group to explain why these microaggressions are harmful or ask if they have encountered them. There are 22 items on the GRMSAAW scale. The frequency scaling ranged included: 0(never), 1 (rarely), 2(sometimes), 3(often), 4(very frequently), and 5(always). The four factors, number of items, and sample item are as follows: Ascribed Submissiveness (9 items) Others expect me to be submissive. (AS1) Others have been surprised when I disagree with them. (AS2) Others take my silence as a sign of compliance. (AS3) Others have been surprised when I do things independent of my family. (AS4) Others have implied that AAW seem content for being a subordinate. (AS5) Others treat me as if I will always comply with their requests. (AS6) Others expect me to sacrifice my own needs to take care of others (e.g., family, partner) because I am an AAW. (AS7) Others have hinted that AAW are not assertive enough to be leaders. (AS8) Others have hinted that AAW seem to have no desire for leadership. (AS9) Asian Fetishism (4 items) Others express sexual interest in me because of my Asian appearance. (AF1) Others take sexual interest in AAW to fulfill their fantasy. (AF2) Others take romantic interest in AAW just because they never had sex with an AAW before. (AF3) Others have treated me as if I am always open to sexual advances. (AF4) Media Invalidation (5 items) I see non-Asian women being casted to play female Asian characters.(MI1) I rarely see AAW playing the lead role in the media. (MI2) I rarely see AAW in the media. (MI3) I see AAW playing the same type of characters (e.g., Kung Fu woman, sidekick, mistress, tiger mom) in the media. (MI4) I see AAW characters being portrayed as emotionally distant (e.g., cold-hearted, lack of empathy) in the media. (MI5) Assumptions of Universal Appearance (4 items) Others have talked about AAW as if they all have the same facial features (e.g., eye shape, skin tone). (AUA1) Others have suggested that all AAW look alike.(AUA2) Others have talked about AAW as if they all have the same body type (e.g., petite, tiny, small-chested). (AUA3) Others have pointed out physical traits in AAW that do not look ‘Asian’. Four additional scales were reported in the Keum et al. article (Keum et al., 2018). Fortunately, I was able to find factor loadings from the original psychometric article or subsequent publications. For multidimensional scales, I assign assign variable names according to the scale to which the item belongs (e.g., Env42). In contrast, when subscales or short unidimensional scales were used, I assigned variable names based on item content (e.g., “blue”). In my own work, I prefer item-level names so that I can quickly see (without having to look up the item names) how the items are behaving. The scales, their original citation, and information about how I simulated data for each are listed below. Racial Microaggressions Scale (RMAS; (Torres-Harding et al., 2012)) is a 32-item scale with Likert scaling ranging from 0 (never) to 3 (often/frequent). Higher scores represent greater frequency of perceived microaggressions. I simulated data at the subscale level. The RMAS has six subscales, but only four (Invisibility, Low-Achieving/Undesirable Culture, Foreigner/Not Belonging,and Environmental Invalidation) were used in the study. Data were simulated using factor loadings (from the four factors) in the source article. Schedule of Sexist Events (SSE; (Klonoff &amp; Landrine, 1995)) is a 20-item scale that with Likert scaling ranging from 1 (the event has never happened to me) to 6 (the event happened almost all [i.e., more than 70%] of the time). Higher scores represent greater frequency of everyday sexist events. I simulated data the subscale level. Within two larger scales (recent events, lifetime events), there are three subscales: Sexist Degradation and Its Consequences, Unfair/Sexist Events at Work/School, and Unfair Treatment in Distant and Close Relationships. Data were simulated using factor loadings fromthe source article. PHQ-9 (Kroenke et al., 2001) is a 9-item scale with Likert scaling ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). Higher scores indicate higher levels of depression. I simulated data by estimating factor loadings from Brattmyr et al. (2022). Internalized Racism in Asian American Scale (IRAAS (Choi et al., 2017)) is a 14-item scale with Likert scaling ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree). Higher scores indicate greater internalized racism. Data were simulated using the factor loadings from the bifactor model in the source article. As you consider homework options, there is sufficient simulated data to use the RMAS, SSE, or IRAAS. Below, I walk through the data simulation. This is not an essential portion of the lesson, but I will lecture it in case you are interested. None of the items are negatively worded (relative to the other items), so there is no need to reverse-score any items. Simulating the data involved using factor loadings, means, standard deviations, and correlations between the scales. Because the simulation will produce “out-of-bounds” values, the code below rescales the scores into the range of the Likert-type scaling and rounds them to whole values. #Entering the intercorrelations, means, and standard deviations from the journal article Keum_GRMS_generating_model &lt;- &#39;

That is, you can re-simulate the data each time you work the problem. #to save the df as an .rds (think &quot;R object&quot;) file on your computer; it should save in the same file as the .rmd file you are working with #saveRDS(dfGRMSAAW, &quot;dfGRMSAAW.rds&quot;) #bring back the simulated dat from an .rds file #dfGRMSAAW &lt;- readRDS(&quot;dfGRMSAAW.rds&quot;) If you save the .csv file (think “Excel lite”) and bring it back in, you will lose any formatting (e.g., ordered factors will be interpreted as character variables). #write the simulated data as a .csv #write.table(dfGRMSAAW, file=&quot;dfGRMSAAW.csv&quot;, sep=&quot;,&quot;, col.names=TRUE, row.names=FALSE) #bring back the simulated dat from a .csv file #dfGRMSAAW &lt;- read.csv (&quot;dfGRMSAAW.csv&quot;, header = TRUE) 10.5.1 Modeling the GRMSAAW as Unidimensional Let’s start simply, taking the GRMSAAW data and seeing about its fit as a unidimensional instrument. In fact, even when measures are presumed to be multi-dimensional, it is common to begin with a unidimensional assessment. Here’s why: Operationally, it’s a check to see that data, script, and so forth. are all working. If you can’t reject a single-factor model (e.g., if there is a strong support for such), then it makes little sense to evaluate models with more factors (Kline, 2016). Considerations for the lavaan code include: GRMSAAW is a latent variable and can be named anything. We know this because it is followed by: =~ All the items follow and are “added” with the plus sign Don’t let this fool you…the assumption behind SEM/CFA is that the LV causes the score on the item/indicator. Recall, item/indicator scores are influenced by the LV and error. The entire model is enclosed in tic marks (’ and ’) grmsAAWmod1 &lt;- &#39;GRMSAAW =~ AS1 + AS2 + AS3 + AS4 + AS5 + AS6 + AS7 + AS8 + AS9 + AF1 + AF2 + AF3 + AF4 + MI1 + MI2 + MI3 + MI4 + MI5 + AUA1 + AUA2 + AUA3 + AUA4&#39; grmsAAWmod1 [1] &quot;GRMSAAW =~ AS1 + AS2 + AS3 + AS4 + AS5 + AS6 + AS7 + AS8 + AS9 + AF1 + AF2 + AF3 + AF4 + MI1 + MI2 + MI3 + MI4 + MI5 + AUA1 + AUA2 + AUA3 + AUA4&quot; The object representing the model is then included in the lavaan::cfa() along with the dataset.

A quick look alerts me to errors. semPlot::semPaths(grmsAAW1fit, layout = &quot;tree&quot;, style = &quot;lisrel&quot;, what = &quot;col&quot;, whatLabels = &quot;stand&quot;) #### Interpreting the Output With a quick look at the plot, let’s work through the results. Rosseel’s (2019) lavaan tutorial is a useful resource in walking through the output. The header is the first few lines of the information. It contains: the lavaan version number (0.6-17 that I’m using on 4/12/24), maximum likelihood (ML) was used as the estimator, confirmation that the specification converged normally after 28 iterations, indication that 304 cases were used in this analysis (this would be less if some were skipped because of missing data), results including the model user test statistic, df, and corresponding p value: \\(\\chi ^{2}(209) = 444.451, p &lt; .001\\). Model Test User Model: Fit statistics are included in the second section. They are only shown when the argument “fit.measures = TRUE” is in the script. Standardized values are not the default, they require the argument, “standardized = TRUE”. We’ll come back to these shortly… Parameter estimates is the last section. For now we are interested in the “Latent Variables” section. Estimate contains the estimated or fixed parameter value for each model parameter; Std. err is the standard error for each estimated parameter; Z-value is the Wald statistic (the parameter divided by its SE) P(&gt;|z|) is the p value for testing the null hypothesis that the parameter equals zero in the population Std.lv standardizes only the LVs Std.all both latent and observed variables are standardized; this is considered the “completely standardized solution” Note that item AS1 might seem incomplete – there is only a 1.000 and a value for the Std.lv. Recall we used this to scale the single factor by fixing its value to 1.000. Coefficients that are fixed to 1.0 to scale a factor have no standard errors and therefore no significance test. The SE and associated \\(p\\) values are associated with the unstandardized estimates. Intuitively, it is easiest for me to understand the relative magnitude of the pattern coefficients by looking at the Std.all column. We can see that the items associated with what we will soon define as the AS factor are all strong and positive. The remaining items have variable loadings with many of the being quite low, non-significant, and even negatively valenced. Let’s examine to the middle set metrics which assess global fit. CFA falls into a modeling approach to evaluating results. While it provides some flexibility (we get away from the strict, NHST appproach of \\(p\\) &lt; .05) there is greater interpretive ambiguity. Fit statistics tend to be clustered together based on their approach to summarizing the goodness or badness of fit. 10.5.1.1 Model Test User Model: The chi-square statistic that evaluates the exact-fit hypothesis that there is no difference between the covariances predicted by the model, given the parameter estimates, and the population covariance matrix. Rejecting the hypothesis says that, the data contain covariance information that speak against the model, and the researcher should explain model-data discrepancies that exceed those expected by sampling error. Traditional interpretion of the chi-square is an accept-support test where the null hypothesis represents the researchers’ believe that the model is correct. This means that the absence of statistical significance (\\(p\\) &gt; .05) that supports the model. This is backwards from our usual reject-support test approach. The \\(\\chi^2\\) is frequently criticized: Accept-support test approaches are logically weaker because the failure to disprove an assertation (the exact-fit hypothesis) does not prove that the assertion is true. Too small a sample size (low power) makes it more likely that the model will be retained. CFA/SEM, requires large samples and so the \\(\\chi^2\\) is frequently statistically significant; this frequently results in rejection of the researchers’ model. Kline (2016) recommends that we treat the \\(\\chi^2\\) like a smoke alarm – if the alarm sounds, there may or may not be a fire (a serious model-data discrepancy), but we should treat the alarm seriously and further inspect issues of fit. For our unidimensional GRMSAAW CFA \\(\\chi ^{2}(209) = 444.451, p &lt; .001\\), the significant p value is not what we want because it says that our specified model is different than the covariances in the model. 10.5.1.2 Model Test Baseline Model This model is the independence model. That is, there is complete independence of of all variables in the model (i.e., in which all correlations among variables are zero). This is the most restricted model. It is typical for chi-quare values to be quite high (as it is in our example: 1439.317). On its own, this model is not useful to us. It is used, though, in comparisons of incremental fit. 10.5.1.3 Incremental Fit Indices (User versus Baseline Models) Incremental fit indices ask the question, how much better is the fit of our specified model to the data then the baseline model (where it is assumed no relations between the variables). The Comparative Fit Index (CFI) and Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) are goodness of fit statistics, ranging from 0 to 1.0 where 1.0 is best. CFI: compares the amount of departure from close fit for the researcher’s model against that of the independence/baseline (null) model. \\[CFI = 1-\\frac{\\hat{\\Delta_{M}}}{\\hat{\\Delta_{B}}}\\] Where there is no departure from close fit, then CFI will equal 1.0. We interpret the value of the CFI as a percent of how much better the researcher’s model is than the baseline model. While 81% sounds like an improvement – Hu and Bentler (1999) stated that “acceptable fit” is achieved when the \\(CFI \\geq .95\\) and \\(SRMR \\leq .08\\); the combination rule. It is important to note that later simulation studies have not supported those thresholds. TLI: aka the non-normed fit index (NNFI) controls for \\(df_M\\) from the researcher’s model and \\(df_B\\) from the baseline model. As such, it imposes a greater relative penalty for model complexity than the CFI. The TLI is a bit unstable in that the values can exceed 1.0. Because the two measures are so related, only one should be reported (I typically see the CFI). For our unidimensional GRMSAAW CFA, CFI = .805 and TLI = .785. While these predict around 81% better than the baseline/independence model, it does not come close to the standard of \\(\\geq .95\\). 10.5.1.4 Loglikelihood and Information Criteria The Aikaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) utilize an information theory approach to data analysis by combing statistical estimation and model selection into a single framework. The BIC augments the AIC by taking sample size into consideration. The AIC and BIC are usually used to select among competing nonhierarchical models and are only used in comparison with each other. Thus our current values of 16862.028 (AIC) and 17025.577 (BIC) are meaningless on their own. The model with the smallest values of the predictive fit indices is chosen as the one that is most likely to replicate. It means that this model has relatively better fit and fewer free parameters than competing models. Later in the lesson we will return to these values to compare a correlated, four-factor solution with this unidimensional model. 10.5.1.5 Root Mean Square Error of Approximation The RMSEA is an absolute fit index scaled as a badness-of-fit statistic where a value of 0.00 is the best fit. The RMSEA favors models with more degrees of freedom and larger sample sizes. A unique aspect of the RMSEA is its 90% confidence interval. While there is chatter/controversy about what constitutes an acceptable value, there is general consensus that \\(RMSEA \\geq .10\\) points to serious problems. An \\(RMSEA\\leq .05\\) is desired. In evaluating the RMSEA, we need to monitor the upper bound of the confidence interval to see that it isn’t sneaking into the danger zone. For our unidimensional GRMSAAW CFA, RMSEA = 0.061, 90% CI(0.053, 0.069). This value is within the range of acceptability. 10.5.1.6 Standardized Root Mean Square Residual The SRMR is an absolute fit index that is a badness-of-fit statistic (i.e., perfect model fit is when the value = 0.00 and increasingly higher values indicate the “badness”). The SRMR is a standardized version of the root mean square residual (RMR), which is a measure of the mean absolute covariance residual. Standardizing the value facilitates interpretation. Poor fit is indicated when \\(SRMR \\geq .10\\). Recall, Hu and Bentler’s combination rule (which is somewhat contested) suggested that the SRMR be interpreted along with the CFI such that: \\(CFI \\geqslant .95\\) and \\(SRMR \\leq .05\\). For our unidimensional GRMSAAW CFA, SRMR = 0.067. Inspecting the residuals (we look for relatively large values) may help understand the source of poor fit, so let’s do that. lavaan::fitted(grmsAAW1fit) $cov AS1 AS2 AS3 AS4 AS5 AS6 AS7 AS8 AS9 AF1

residuals. In our output, these seem to be the “cor.bollen” and are near the bottom. He recommends that residuals &gt; .10 may be possible sources for misfit. He also indicated that patterns may be helpful (is there an item that has consistently high residuals). Kline also cautions that there is no dependable or trustworthy connection between the size of the residual and the type or degree of model misspecification. My first read of our results is that the items in the AS# factor were well-defined. I suspect that a multi-factor solution will improve the fit. The semTable package can help us extract the values into a .csv file which will make it easier to create an APA style table. It takes some tinkering… #library(semTable) #I took out commas internal to the items because the comma causes the text to split across columns in the exported .csv v1 &lt;- c(AS1 = &quot;Others expect me to be submissive&quot;, AS2 = &quot;Others have been surprised when I disagree with them&quot;, AS3 = &quot;Others take my silence as a sign of compliance&quot;, AS4 = &quot;Others have been surprised when I do things independent of my family&quot;, AS5 = &quot;Others have implied that AAW seem content for being a subordinate&quot;, AS6 = &quot;Others treat me as if I will always comply with their requests&quot;, AS7 = &quot;Others expect me to sacrifice my own needs to take care of others (eg family partner) ecause I am an AAW&quot;, AS8 = &quot;Others have hinted that AAW are not assertive enough to be leaders&quot;, AS9 = &quot;Others have hinted that AAW seem to have no desire for leadership&quot;, AF1 = &quot;Others express sexual interest in me because of my Asian appearance&quot;, AF2 = &quot;Others take sexual interest in AAW to fulfill their fantasy&quot;, AF3 = &quot;Others take romantic interest in AAW just because they never had sex with an AAW before&quot;, AF4 = &quot;Others have treated me as if I am always open to sexual advances&quot;, MI1 = &quot;I see non-Asian women being casted to play female Asian characters&quot;, MI2 = &quot;I rarely see AAW playing the lead role in the media&quot;, MI3 = &quot;I rarely see AAW in the media&quot;, MI4 = &quot;I see AAW playing the same type of characters (eg Kung Fu woman sidekick mistress tiger mom) in the media&quot;, MI5 = &quot;I see AAW charaters being portrayed as emotionally distanct (eg cold-hearted lack of empathy) in the media&quot;, AUA1 = &quot;Others have talked about AAW as if they all have the same facial features (eg eye shape skin tone)&quot;, AUA2 = &quot;Others have suggested that all AAW look alike&quot;, AUA3 = &quot;Others have talked about AAW as if they all have the same body type (eg petite tiny small-chested&quot;, AUA4 = &quot;Others have pointed out physical traits in AAW that do not look &#39;Asian&#39;&quot;) grmsAAW1table &lt;- semTable::semTable(grmsAAW1fit, columns = c(&quot;eststars&quot;, &quot;se&quot;, &quot;p&quot;), columnLabels = c(eststars = &quot;Estimate&quot;, se = &quot;SE&quot;, p = &quot;p-value&quot;), fits = c(&quot;chisq&quot;, &quot;df&quot;, &quot;pvalue&quot;, &quot;cfi&quot;, &quot;rmsea&quot;, &quot;rmsea.ci.lower&quot;, &quot;rmsea.ci.upper&quot;, &quot;srmr&quot;, &quot;aic&quot;, &quot;bic&quot;), varLabels = v1, file = &quot;grmsAAW1table&quot;, type = &quot;csv&quot;, print.results = FALSE ) #Can change &quot;print.results&quot; to TRUE if you want to see the (messy) output in the .rmd file (it&#39;s easier to read the lavaan output). Unfortunately, this does not contain the standardized estimates. One way to get them is to create an updated model with the standardized output: grmsAAW1stdzd &lt;- update (grmsAAW1fit, std.lv = TRUE, std.ov = TRUE, meanstructure = TRUE) Now request both models in the semTable grmsAAW1table &lt;- semTable::semTable(list (&quot;Ordinary&quot; = grmsAAW1fit, &quot;Standardized&quot; = grmsAAW1stdzd), columns = list (&quot;Ordinary&quot; = c(&quot;eststars&quot;, &quot;se&quot;, &quot;p&quot;), &quot;Standardized&quot; = c(&quot;est&quot;)), columnLabels = c(eststars = &quot;Estimate&quot;, se = &quot;SE&quot;, p = &quot;p-value&quot;), fits = c(&quot;chisq&quot;, &quot;df&quot;, &quot;pvalue&quot;, &quot;cfi&quot;, &quot;rmsea&quot;, &quot;rmsea.ci.lower&quot;, &quot;rmsea.ci.upper&quot;, &quot;srmr&quot;, &quot;aic&quot;, &quot;bic&quot;), varLabels = v1, file = &quot;grmsAAW1table&quot;, type = &quot;csv&quot;, print.results = FALSE ) #Can change &quot;print.results&quot; to TRUE if you want to see the (messy) output in the .rmd file (it&#39;s easier to read the lavaan output). Troubleshooting If, while working with this function you get the error, “Error in file(file, ifelse(append,”a”, “w”)) : cannot open the connection” it is because the .csv file that received your table is still open. R is just trying to write over it. A similar error happens when knitting, or updating any spreadsheet or word document. 10.5.1.7 APA Style Results from the Unidimensional model Writing up an APA style results section for a CFA involves describing the statistics that are being used and then presenting the results. Model testing. To evaluate the models we, we used confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) in the R package, lavaan (v.0-6.9) with maximum likelihood estimation. Our sample size was 304. We selected fit criteria for their capacity to assess different aspects of the statistical analysis. As is common among SEM researchers, we reported the Chi-square goodness of fit (\\(\\chi^2\\)). This evaluates the discrepancy between the unrestricted sample matrix and the restricted covariance matrix. Although the associated \\(p\\) value indicates adequate fit when the value is non-significant, it is widely recognized that large sample size can result in a statistically significant p value (Byrne, 2016). The comparative fit index (CFI) is an incremental index, comparing the hypothesized modelat least .90 and perhaps higher than .95 (Kline, 2016). The root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) takes into account the error of approximation in the population and expresses it per degree of freedom. As such, the fit indicator considers the complexity of the model. Ideal values are equal to or less than .05, values less than .08 represent reasonable fit, and values between .08 and .10 represent mediocre fit. The standardized root mean residual is a standardized measure of the mean absolute covariance residual – the overall difference between the observed and predicted correlations. Values greater than .10 may indicate poor fit and inspection of residuals is then advised. Kline (2016) advised researchers to be cautious when using these criteria as strict cut-offs. Elements such as sample size and model complexity should be considered when evaluating fit. Our first model was unidimensional where each of the 24 items loaded onto a single factor representing overall, gendered racial microaggressions towards Asian American women. The Chi-square index was statistically signficant (\\(\\chi ^{2}(209) = 444.451, p &lt; .001\\)) indicating likely misfit. The CFI value of .81 indicated poor fit. In contrast, the RMSEA = 0.061, 90% CI(0.053, 0.069) and SRMR = 0.067both fell within the ranges of acceptability. The AIC and BIC values were 16862.028 and 17025.577, respectively, and will become useful in comparing subsequent models. 10.5.2 Modeling the GRMSAAW as a First-Order, 4-factor model 10.5.2.1 Specifying and Running the Model As we know from the article, the GRMSAAW has four subscales. Therefore, let’s respecify it as a first-order, four-factor model, allowing the factors to correlate. Model identification is always a consideration. In a multi-dimensional model, each factor requires a minimum of two items/indicators. Our shortest scales are the AF and AUA scales, each with 4 items, so we should be identified. We will be using the cfa() function in lavaan.

This permits me to inspect for modeling errors “at a glance.” semPlot::semPaths(grmsAAW4fit, layout = &quot;tree&quot;, style = &quot;lisrel&quot;, what = &quot;col&quot;, whatLabels = &quot;stand&quot;) Among my first steps are also to write the code to create a table that includes the standardized results. grmsAAW4stdzd &lt;- update (grmsAAW4fit, std.lv = TRUE, std.ov = TRUE, meanstructure = TRUE) grmsAAW4table &lt;- semTable::semTable(list (&quot;Ordinary&quot; =grmsAAW4fit, &quot;Standardized&quot; = grmsAAW4stdzd), columns = list (&quot;Ordinary&quot; = c(&quot;eststars&quot;, &quot;se&quot;, &quot;p&quot;), &quot;Standardized&quot; = c(&quot;est&quot;)), columnLabels = c(eststars = &quot;Estimate&quot;, se = &quot;SE&quot;, p = &quot;p-value&quot;), fits = c(&quot;chisq&quot;, &quot;df&quot;, &quot;pvalue&quot;, &quot;cfi&quot;, &quot;rmsea&quot;, &quot;rmsea.ci.lower&quot;, &quot;rmsea.ci.upper&quot;, &quot;srmr&quot;, &quot;aic&quot;, &quot;bic&quot;), varLabels = v1, file = &quot;grmsAAW4table&quot;, type = &quot;csv&quot;, print.results = FALSE ) #Can change &quot;print.results&quot; to TRUE if you want to see the (messy) output in the .rmd file (it&#39;s easier to read the lavaan output). 10.5.2.2 Interpretation Let’s interpret hte results. Our model converged, normally, with 42 iterations. The estimator was the lavaan default, maximum likelihood (ML). All 304 cases were used in the analysis. I mapped our pattern coefficients into the GRMSAAW tables. Most pattern coefficients are strong, significant, and stably connected to their respective factor. The lowest factor loading was 0.332 (MI5). A multidimensional factor structure also includes correlations/covariances between factors. We can see that the correlation (look at the Std.all column) shows the following correlations (all are statistically significant): AS &amp; AF: 0.533 AS &amp; MI: 0.513 AS &amp; AUA: 0.595 AF &amp; MI: 0.632 AF &amp; AUA: 0.588 MI &amp; AUA: 0.709 For our multi-dimensional GRMSAAW4 CFA \\(\\chi ^{2}(203)=232.453, p = 0.076\\), this non-significant p value is exactly what we want because it says that our specified model is not statistically significantly different than the covariances in the model. That is, our more parsimonious model is a reasonable explanation (simplification). The CFI and TLI compare user (the 4-dimensional model we specified) and baseline (where no relations would exist between variables) models. These values will always be close together because the only difference is that the TLI imposes a penalty for any model complexity. The CFI seems to be more commonly reported and its value is 0.976. This means our model performed 98% better than a model with no relations. It well-exceeds the traditional cutoffs of .90 and the more strict cutoff of .95. The TLI imposes a greater relative penalty for model complexity, consequently it is a smidge lower at 0.972. The RMSEA one of the badness of fit, absolute fit index, statistics where a value of 0.00 is the best fit. Our RMSEA = 0.022 (90%CI[.000, 0.034]). As a quick reminder, an there is general consensus that \\(RMSEA\\leq .05\\) is desired and an \\(RMSEA \\geq .10\\) points to serious problems. We watch the upper bound of the confidence interval to see that it isn’t sneaking into the danger zone. The SRMR is another absolute, badness of fit index (i.e., perfect model fit is when the value = 0.00 and increasingly higher values indicate the “badness”). The SRMR is a measure of the mean absolute covariance residual. Standardizing the value facilitates interpretation. Poor fit is indicated when \\(SRMR \\geq .10\\). The GRMSAAW SRMR = 0.047. Recall, Hu and Bentler’s combination rule (which is somewhat contested) suggested that the SRMR be interpreted along with the CFI such that: \\(CFI \\geq .95\\) and \\(SRMR \\leq .08\\). For our unidimensional GRMSAAW CFA, the CFI = 0.976 and the SRMR = 0.047. Our results fell within that acceptable range! The AIC and BIC utilize an information theory approach to data analysis by combing statistical estimation and model selection into a single framework. The BIC augments the AIC by taking sample size into consideration. We can compare the values from our current model to the former one. The model with the smallest value of the predictive fit index is chosen as the one that is most likely to replicate. It means that this model has relatively better fit and fewer free parameters than competing models. We will do that in the next section. Before moving to model comparison, it is a good practice for locating sources of misfit (we look for relatively large values) is to inspect the residuals (in the “cor.bollen” section), so let’s do that. lavaan::fitted(grmsAAW4fit) $cov AS1 AS2 AS3 AS4 AS5 AS6 AS7 AS8 AS9 AF1 AF2 AF3 AS1 0.841 AS2 0.343 1.020 AS3 0.290 0.328 0.883 AS4 0.273 0.309 0.261 0.856 AS5 0.349 0.395 0.334 0.314 0.958 AS6 0.203 0.229 0.194 0.183 0.233 0.537 AS7 0.251 0.284 0.240 0.226 0.289 0.168 0.849 AS8 0.274 0.310 0.262 0.247 0.315 0.183 0.227 0.849 AS9 0.229 0.259 0.220 0.207 0.264 0.153 0.190 0.207 0.658 AF1 0.148 0.168 0.142 0.133 0.171 0.099 0.123 0.134 0.112 0.803 AF2 0.177 0.200 0.169 0.159 0.204 0.118 0.147 0.160 0.134 0.305 0.943 AF3 0.109 0.124 0.105 0.098 0.126 0.073 0.091 0.099 0.083 0.188 0.225 0.781 AF4 0.168 0.191 0.161 0.152 0.194 0.113 0.140 0.152 0.127 0.290 0.347 0.214 MI1 0.136 0.154 0.130 0.123 0.157 0.091 0.113 0.123 0.103 0.154 0.184 0.114 MI2 0.125 0.141 0.120 0.112 0.144 0.084 0.103 0.113 0.094 0.141 0.169 0.104 MI3 0.159 0.180 0.152 0.143 0.183 0.106 0.132 0.144 0.120 0.180 0.215 0.133 MI4 0.125 0.142 0.120 0.113 0.144 0.084 0.104 0.113 0.095 0.142 0.169 0.105 MI5 0.094 0.106 0.090 0.084 0.108 0.063 0.078 0.085 0.071 0.106 0.126 0.078 AUA1 0.181 0.205 0.174 0.163 0.209 0.121 0.150 0.164 0.137 0.164 0.196 0.121 AUA2 0.178 0.201 0.170 0.160 0.205 0.119 0.147 0.161 0.135 0.161 0.193 0.119 AUA3 0.142 0.161 0.136 0.128 0.164 0.095 0.118 0.129 0.108 0.129 0.154 0.095 AUA4 0.196 0.222 0.188 0.177 0.226 0.131 0.163 0.178 0.149 0.178 0.213 0.131 AF4 MI1 MI2 MI3 MI4 MI5 AUA1 AUA2 AUA3 AUA4 AS1 AS2 AS3 AS4 AS5 AS6 AS7 AS8 AS9 AF1 AF2 AF3 AF4 0.968 MI1 0.175 0.697 MI2 0.160 0.213 0.777 MI3 0.205 0.271 0.249 1.048 MI4 0.161 0.214 0.196 0.250 0.926 MI5 0.120 0.160 0.147 0.187 0.147 0.775 AUA1 0.187 0.189 0.173 0.221 0.174 0.130 1.036 AUA2 0.183 0.185 0.170 0.217 0.171 0.128 0.300 0.796 AUA3 0.147 0.148 0.136 0.173 0.137 0.102 0.240 0.236 0.676 AUA4 0.202 0.205 0.188 0.239 0.189 0.141 0.331 0.325 0.260 0.904 #lavaan::residuals(grmsAAW4fit, type = &quot;raw&quot;) #lavaan::residuals(grmsAAW4fit, type = &quot;standardized&quot;) lavaan::residuals(grmsAAW4fit, type = &quot;cor&quot;) $type [1] &quot;cor.bollen&quot; $cov AS1 AS2 AS3 AS4 AS5 AS6 AS7 AS8 AS9 AF1 AS1 0.000 AS2 0.009 0.000 AS3 0.009 0.028 0.000 AS4 0.009 0.042 0.019 0.000 AS5 0.065 -0.038 -0.069 -0.002 0.000 AS6 -0.018 0.037 -0.024 -0.080 0.007 0.000 AS7 -0.058 -0.010 0.035 0.027 -0.006 -0.049 0.000 AS8 -0.057 0.015 -0.002 -0.028 0.027 0.009 0.028 0.000 AS9 0.010 0.024 -0.033 0.007 0.003 0.052 -0.024 0.007 0.000 AF1 -0.035 -0.081 0.091 0.011 -0.033 -0.050 -0.038 0.012 -0.040 0.000 AF2 0.025 -0.082 0.021 0.083 0.024 0.008 0.026 0.073 0.044 -0.014 AF3 0.003 -0.095 0.079 -0.060 -0.005 -0.038 0.000 0.013 0.037 0.099 AF4 -0.052 -0.029 0.046 0.045 0.034 -0.014 0.038 -0.024 -0.050 0.031 MI1 -0.036 -0.046 -0.006 -0.016 -0.029 0.078 0.051 -0.009 -0.057 0.038 MI2 -0.080 0.025 -0.016 -0.015 0.010 0.038 0.087 -0.029 -0.063 -0.130 MI3 -0.028 0.016 0.032 -0.017 0.016 0.071 -0.027 0.085 0.046 -0.051 MI4 -0.081 -0.098 0.014 -0.132 -0.060 0.015 0.103 -0.044 -0.011 -0.063 MI5 0.086 0.025 0.045 0.094 0.062 0.056 0.085 0.031 -0.033 -0.014 AUA1 -0.056 -0.107 0.014 -0.110 -0.032 0.021 0.017 0.007 -0.108 -0.151 AUA2 0.016 -0.031 -0.013 -0.062 0.020 0.067 0.016 -0.012 -0.045 -0.028 AUA3 0.037 0.000 0.033 -0.023 -0.027 0.079 0.003 -0.084 0.006 -0.024 AUA4 0.062 -0.024 0.040 0.063 0.067 0.015 0.105 0.002 -0.022 0.025 AF2 AF3 AF4 MI1 MI2 MI3 MI4 MI5 AUA1 AUA2 AS1 AS2 AS3 AS4 AS5 AS6 AS7 AS8 AS9 AF1 AF2 0.000 AF3 -0.054 0.000 AF4 -0.015 -0.027 0.000 MI1 0.122 0.000 0.037 0.000 MI2 -0.090 -0.030 0.030 -0.018 0.000 MI3 0.004 -0.022 -0.030 -0.007 0.094 0.000 MI4 0.013 -0.012 -0.016 0.008 -0.010 0.030 0.000 MI5 0.067 0.093 0.028 -0.088 -0.017 -0.071 0.057 0.000 AUA1 0.023 0.012 -0.042 0.036 0.062 0.011 -0.010 0.022 0.000 AUA2 0.022 -0.008 0.019 -0.008 0.011 -0.051 -0.048 0.085 0.046 0.000 AUA3 0.046 0.011 -0.065 -0.038 -0.005 -0.046 0.036 0.071 0.023 -0.001 AUA4 0.045 0.017 0.033 0.054 -0.045 -0.049 -0.021 0.034 -0.024 -0.021 AUA3 AUA4 AS1 AS2 AS3 AS4 AS5 AS6 AS7 AS8 AS9 AF1 AF2 AF3 AF4 MI1 MI2 MI3 MI4 MI5 AUA1 AUA2 AUA3 0.000 AUA4 -0.007 0.000 #lavaan::modindices(grmsAAW4fit) 10.6 Model Comparison We evaluated two models (i.e., a unidimensional model and four-factor correlated model), which one is better?

Easy are AIC and BIC comparisons where “smaller value wins.” AIC GRMSAAW1: 16862.028 AIC GRMSAAW4: 16662.030 BIC GRMSAAW1: 17025.577 BIC GRMSAAW4: 16847.882 In both cases, the smaller values are for the more complex, 4-dimensional model. The interpretation is that the model with the smaller AIC/BIC values is most likely to replicate. Additionally, the chi-square difference test, \\(\\chi_{D}^{2}\\) can be used to compare nested models. Single-factor CFA models are nested under any other CFA model with two or more factors for the same indicators. This is because a one-factor model is a restricted version of any model with multiple factors. Our unidimensional GRMSAAW was nested under the 4-factor GRMSAAW model. To calculate the chi-square difference test, we first grab the chi-square test values: GRMSAAW1: \\(\\chi ^{2}(209) = 444.451, p &lt; .001\\) GRMSAAW4: \\(\\chi ^{2}(203) = 232.453, p = 0.076\\) Given both sets of results we calculate: \\(\\chi ^{2}(6)= 211.998, p &lt; .05\\) and determine that the two models are statistically significantly different. Given that the fit statistics are better for the single-order, correlated, four-factor model, we prefer that one. How did I do that? Subtract the df Subtract the chi-square values Use a chi-square difference table to look up the chi-square critical value for a 6 df test https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/eda3674.htm, or use this code to look it up qchisq(p, df, lower.tail=FALSE) the critical value for our test is 12.592 We conclude that the two models are statistically significantly different; our 4-factor model is preferred. 209-203 #subtract df [1] 6 444.451 - 232.453 #subtract chi-square values [1] 211.998 qchisq(.05, 6, lower.tail=FALSE) [1] 12.59159 Of course, there is a function for something this easy: lavaan::lavTestLRT(grmsAAW1fit, grmsAAW4fit) Chi-Squared Difference Test Df AIC BIC Chisq Chisq diff RMSEA Df diff grmsAAW4fit 203 16662 16848 232.45 grmsAAW1fit 209 16862 17026 444.45 212 0.33606 6 Pr(&gt;Chisq) grmsAAW4fit grmsAAW1fit &lt; 0.00000000000000022 *** --- Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 And we get the same result: \\(\\chi ^{2}(6)= 212, p &lt; .001\\) And now a table with estimates and fit indices from both models. #All the requested data gets transferred over, but the pattern coefficients do not end up side-by-side.

To evaluate the models we, we used confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) in the R package, lavaan (v.0-6.9) with maximum likelihood estimation. Our sample size was 304. We selected fit criteria for their capacity to assess different aspects of the statistical analysis. As is common among SEM researchers, we reported the Chi-square goodness of fit (\\(\\chi^2\\)). This evaluates the discrepancy between the unrestricted sample matrix and the restricted covariance matrix. Although the associated \\(p\\) value indicates adequate fit when the value is non-significant, it is widely recognized that large sample size can result in a statistically significant p value (Byrne, 2016). The comparative fit index (CFI) is an incremental index, comparing the hypothesized modelat least .90 and perhaps higher than .95 (Kline, 2016). The root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) takes into account the error of approximation in the population and expresses it per degree of freedom. As such, the fit indicator considers the complexity of the model. Ideal values are equal to or less than .05, values less than .08 represent reasonable fit, and values between .08 and .10 represent mediocre fit. The standardized root mean residual is a standardized measure of the mean absolute covariance residual – the overall difference between the observed and predicted correlations. Values greater than .10 may indicate poor fit and inspection of residuals is then advised. Kline (2016) advised researchers to be cautious when using these criteria as strict cut-offs. Elements such as sample size and model complexity should be considered when evaluating fit. Table 1 provides a side-by-side comparison of the resulting parameter estimates and fit statistics; Figures 1 and 2 provide a graphic representation of the models tested. Our first model was unidimensional where each of the 24 items loaded onto a single factor representing overall, gendered racial microaggressions towards Asian American women. The Chi-square index was statistically signficant (\\(\\chi ^{2}(209) = 444.451, p &lt; .001\\)) indicating likely misfit. The CFI value of .81 indicated poor fit. In contrast, the RMSEA = 0.061, 90% CI(0.053, 0.069) and SRMR = 0.067both fell within the ranges of acceptability. The AIC and BIC values were 16862.028 and 17025.577, respectively, and will become useful in comparing subsequent models. Our second model was a single-order, multidimensional model where each of the 22 items loaded onto one of four factors. Standardized pattern coefficients ranged between .37 and .60 on the AF factor, between .37 and .63 on the AS factor, between .33 and .56 on the MI factor, and between .43 and .60 on the AUA factor. The Chi-square index was statistically signficant (\\(\\chi ^{2}(203)=232.453, p = 0.076\\)) indicating reasonable fit. The CFI value of 0.972 exceeded the recommendation of .95. The RMSEA = MSEA = 0.022 (90%CI[.000, 0.034]) was satisfactory. The SRMR value of 0.047 remained below the warning criteria of .10. The AIC and BIC values were 16662.030 and 16847.882, respectively. The Chi-square difference test (\\(\\chi ^{2}(6)= 211.998, p &lt; .001\\)) was statistically significant and AIC and BIC values of the multidimensional value were lowest. Thus, we conclude the multidimensional model (i.e., the first-order, correlated factors model) is superior and acceptable for use in preliminary research and evaluation. We will continue to create, evaluate, and compare models in the next lesson. 10.7 A concluding thought Much like the children’s game Don’t Break the Ice we start with a full, saturated, matrix of sample data where every indicator/item is allowed to correlate/covary with every other. As researchers, we specify a more parsimonious model where we fix some relations to zero and allow others to relate. In our GRMSAAW example, we allowed the AF items to relate via their relationship to the AF factor; the AS items to relate via their relationship to the AS factor; the MI items to relate via their relationship to the MI factor; and the AUA items to relate via their relationship to the AUA factor. we did not allow any of the items on any given factor to relate to the items on any other factor; these are hard hypotheses where we fix the relation to zero. Our goal (especially via the chi-square test) is that we account for as much variance as possible through the specified relations that remain. Harkening to the Don’t Break the Ice metaphor, we want the ice matrix to remain stable with as many ice cubes deleted as possible.

In psychometrics, I strongly recommend that you have started with a dataset that has a minimum of three subscales and use it for all of the assignments in the OER. In any case, please plan to: Prepare the data frame for CFA. Specify and run unidimensional and single order (with correlated factors) models. In the next chapter, you will add the specification, evaluation, and write-up of second-order and bifactor models. Narrate the adequacy of fit with \\(\\chi ^{2}\\), CFI, RMSEA, SRMR Write a mini-results section for each Compare model fit with \\(\\chi ^{2}\\Delta\\), AIC, and BIC. Write an APA style results sections with table(s) and figures. 10.8.1 Problem #1: Play around with this simulation. The least complex is to change the random seed in the research and rework the problem demonstrated in the lesson. The results should map onto the ones obtained in the lecture. 10.8.2 Problem #2: Use simulated data from other lessons. The second option involves utilizing one of the simulated datasets available in this OER. The last lesson in the OER contains three simulations that could be used for all of the statistics-based practice suggestions. Especially if you started with one of these examples in an earlier lesson, I highly recommend you continue with that. Alternatively, Lewis and Neville’s (2015) Gendered Racial Microaggressions Scale for Black Women was used in the lessons for exploratory factor analysis and Conover et al.’s (2017) Ableist Microaggressions Scale is used in the lesson on invariance testing. Both of these would be suitable for the CFA homework assignments. 10.8.3 Problem #3: Try something entirely new. As a third option, you are welcome to use data to which you have access and is suitable for CFA. This could include other simulated data, data found on an open access repository, data from the ReCentering Psych Stats survey described in the Qualtrics lesson, or your own data (presuming you have permission to use it). 10.8.4 Grading Rubric Using the lecture and workflow (chart) as a guide, please work through all the steps listed in the proposed assignment/grading rubric.

As a brief review, this data is part of an IRB-approved study, with consent to use in teaching demonstrations and to be made available to the general public via the open science framework. Hence, it is appropriate to use in this context. You will notice there are student- and teacher- IDs. These numbers are not actual student and teacher IDs, rather they were further re-identified so that they could not be connected to actual people. Because this is an actual dataset, if you wish to work the problem along with me, you will need to download the ReC.rds data file from the Worked_Examples folder in the ReC_Psychometrics project on the GitHub. The course evaluation items can be divided into three subscales: Valued by the student includes the items: ValObjectives, IncrUnderstanding, IncrInterest Traditional pedagogy includes the items: ClearResponsibilities, EffectiveAnswers, Feedback, ClearOrganization, ClearPresentation Socially responsive pedagogy includes the items: InclusvClassrm, EquitableEval, MultPerspectives, DEIintegration In this homewoRked example I will …. My hope is that the results will support my solution of three dimensions: valued-by-the-student, traditional pedagogy, socially responsive pedagogy. 10.9.1 Prepare data for CFA (items only df, reverse-scored) We an upload the data from the .rds file.

To evaluate the models we, we used confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) in the R package, lavaan (v.0-6.17) with maximum likelihood estimation. Our sample size was 267 We selected fit criteria for their capacity to assess different aspects of the statistical analysis. As is common among SEM researchers, we reported the Chi-square goodness of fit (χ2). This evaluates the discrepancy between the unrestricted sample matrix and the restricted covariance matrix. Although the associated p-value indicates adequate fit when the value is non-significant, it is widely recognized that a large sample size can result in a statistically significant p value (Byrne, 2016b). The comparative fit index (CFI) is an incremental index, comparing the hypothesized model at least .90 and perhaps higher than .95 (Kline, 2016). The root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) takes into account the error of approximation in the population and expresses it per degree of freedom. As such, the fit indicator considers the complexity of the model. Ideal values are equal to or less than .05, values less than .08 represent reasonable fit, and values between .08 and .10 represent mediocre fit. The standardized root mean residual is a standardized measure of the mean absolute covariance residual – the overall difference between the observed and predicted correlations. Values greater than .10 may indicate poor fit and inspection of residuals is then advised. Kline (2016) advised researchers to be cautious when using these criteria as strict cut-offs. Elements such as sample size and model complexity should be considered when evaluating fit. Our first model was unidimensional where each of the 12 items loaded onto a single factor representing overall course evaluations.

Thus, we conclude the multidimensional model (i.e., the first-order, correlated factors model) is superior and acceptable for use in preliminary research and evaluation. 10.9.7 APA style results with table(s) and figure Because we have written mini-results throughout, we can assemble them into a full results section. Keep in mind that most CFA models will continue testing multidimensional models. Thus, the entire analysis continues in the next lesson and associated practice problem. Model testing. To evaluate the models we, we used confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) in the R package, lavaan (v.0-6.17) with maximum likelihood estimation. Our sample size was 267 We selected fit criteria for their capacity to assess different aspects of the statistical analysis. As is common among SEM researchers, we reported the Chi-square goodness of fit (χ2). This evaluates the discrepancy between the unrestricted sample matrix and the restricted covariance matrix. Although the associated p-value indicates adequate fit when the value is non-significant, it is widely recognized that a large sample size can result in a statistically significant p value (Byrne, 2016b). The comparative fit index (CFI) is an incremental index, comparing the hypothesized model at least .90 and perhaps higher than .95 (Kline, 2016). The root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) takes into account the error of approximation in the population and expresses it per degree of freedom. As such, the fit indicator considers the complexity of the model. Ideal values are equal to or less than .05, values less than .08 represent reasonable fit, and values between .08 and .10 represent mediocre fit. The standardized root mean residual is a standardized measure of the mean absolute covariance residual – the overall difference between the observed and predicted correlations. Values greater than .10 may indicate poor fit and inspection of residuals is then advised. Kline (2016) advised researchers to be cautious when using these criteria as strict cut-offs. Elements such as sample size and model complexity should be considered when evaluating fit. Our first model was unidimensional where each of the 12 items loaded onto a single factor representing overall course evaluations. The Chi-square index was statistically significant \\((\\chi^2(54)=344.97, p&lt;.001)\\) indicating likely misfit. The CFI value of .85 indicated poor fit. The RMSEA = .14 (90% CI [.13, .16]) suggested serious problems. The SRMR value of .07 was higher than .05, but was below the warning criteria of .10. The AIC and BIC values were 6124.13 and 6134.13, respectively, and will become useful in comparing subsequent models. Our second model was a single-order, multidimensional model where each of the 12 items loaded onto one of four factors. Standardized pattern coefficients ranged between .74 and .85 on the TradPed factor, between .56 and .84 on the Valued factor, and between .57 and .85 on the SCRPed factor. The Chi-square index was statistically significant \\((\\chi^2(51) = 224.795, p &lt; 0.001\\) indicating some degree of misfit. The CFI value of .91 fell below the recommendation of .95.

The AIC and BIC values of the the correlated factors model were the lowest. Thus, we conclude the multidimensional model (i.e., the first-order, correlated factors model) is superior and acceptable for use in preliminary research and evaluation. 10.9.8 Explanation to grader REFERENCES "],["sims.html", "Chapter 11 Additional Simulations 11.1 iBelong Scale 11.2 Identity Threat 11.3 Anti-Racism Behavioral Inventory", " Chapter 11 Additional Simulations Screencast Link In each of the suggestions for practice (i.e., “homework”), I suggest that an option for a middle-level degree of difficulty is to use data from another set of simulated data. One option is use simulations from other lessons. Especially in the early chapters, it is difficult to know what data from later chapters might be appropriate for such analyses. Because of this challenge, I am providing several simulations that are not used in any of the lessons that could be used as practice for all of the lessons that involve psychometric evaluation. In this way, you would follow the construction of a scale through the standard process. There are a few caveats to this process: In each of the simulations, I have added the code, “eval = FALSE” in the top of the chunk. This prevents the chunk from executing when the OER is building. If you copy the script you should have no problems (but if you try to knit an .rmd file and wonder why no data is being produced, this is why). Each of the psychometric evaluations included a number of additional measures used to assess convergent, discriminant, concurrent, predictive, and incremental validity. While I would have liked to have included them all, I could not always locate source articles, and Adding too many scales caused my simulation code to fail. Thus, each simulation includes at least three additional measures that can be used for evaluating validity as it relates to measures within the nomological net (e.g., convergent, discriminant, concurrent, predictive, incremental). There are two simulations with each scale. The first simulation provides the focal scale and the additional instruments. The second simulation creates “A” and “B” data for the focal scale. When you are practicing test-retest reliability, you can pretend that A and B are from the same respondents. Later, when you are practicing invariance testing you can pretend that the data are from two different groups. At least one of these scales as five subscales. In certain analyses (e.g., item analysis) this may become unwieldy. In such cases you may wish to select three of those subscales and run the analyses with just those. After all, “it’s just practice.” I do recommend that you complete the majority of practice assignments with a minimum of three subscales. Each of the simulations includes a random seed. If you and homework partners would like to work on the same simulation, you could gently increase your challenge by setting different random seeds and comparing the subtle differences in the solutions. I recommend that you retrieve the original psychometric article so that you can compare your analytic choices and results with those completed in the article. At least two of the articles are available as preprints or in open source journals. 11.1 iBelong Scale The iBelong Scale (Lee &amp; Neville, 2024) is a measure of racial-ethnic-cultural (REC) belonging for BIPOC people. The scale includes 25 items with responses rated on a 6 point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree). At the start of the survey, participants are asked to self-identify their REC identity (i.e., “In terms of my racial-ethnic-cultural [REC] identity I consider myself to be:____”). Higher scores indicate a stronger sense of REC belonging. Lee and Neville (2024) reported that a five-factor solution resulted in the best fit. Beneath each of the five factors are a list of the items; variable names follow in parentheses. Authenticity: In general, I do not have to change my behaviors when I am with REC group members (Auth1) I am free to be myself with members of my REC group (Auth2) In general, I do not have to hide parts of who I am with members of my REC group (Auth3) Members of my REC group see me for who I am (Auth4) I feel accepted by my REC group for who Iam (Auth5) Connection: I have similar experiences to others in my REC group (Conn1) Others in my REC group see the world in a similar way as me (Conn2) My success is connected to the success of members of my REC group (Conn3) I have many things in common with people from my REC group (Conn4) I feel connected to my REC group because of our shared experiences (Conn5) Home I feel close to other members of my REC group (Home1) I have shared interests with others in my REC group (Home2) I have shared values with others in my REC group (Home3) In general, I am at ease when I am with people from my REC group (Home4) In general, I feel “at home” when I am with members of my REC group (Home5) REC Thriving I am happy that I am a member of my REC group (Thriv1) I am proud to be a member of my REC group (Thriv2) I like learning about my REC group’s history (Thriv3) I value my REC group (Thriv4) I consider it an honor to be a member of my REC group (Thriv5) *Self-Definition I define what belonging to my REC group means to me (Self1) I am a member of my REC group on my own terms (Self2) I decide what my REC group membership is (Self3) I do not have to prove that I belong to my REC group to others in my REC group (Self4) Others do not define my belonging to my REC group (Self5) A preprint of the article is available at ResearchGate. Below is the script for simulating item-level data from the factor loadings, means, and sample size presented in the published article. Six additional scales were reported in the Lee and Neville (2024) article. Optimizing the ability for the simulation to converge and also to provide an array of scales within the nomological net, I chose the three scales below. Unfortunately, I could not locate factor loadings for all of them; in these cases I uniformly assigned the factor loading of 0.8. The scales, their original citation, and information about how I simulated data for each are listed below. General Belongingness Scale [GBS; Malone et al. (2012)] is a 12-item item scale with Likert scaling ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). There are two six-item subsales: Acceptance/Inclusion (“When I am with other people, I feel included”) and Rejection/Exclusion (“I feel like an outsider”). The items on the Rejection/Exclusion subscale must be rescored such that higher scores represent a greater sense of belonging in general. In the iBELONG study (Lee &amp; Neville, 2024), only a total GBS scale was used. My simulation used factor loadings from Malone et al. (2012) but treated them as a single scale. This means that there is need to reverse-score the Rejection/Exclusion items in this simulated data. The Collective Self-Esteem Scale–Race Specific Version [CSESR; Crocker et al. (1994)] is a 16-item scale with Likert scaling ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Higher scores represent a stronger sense of membership with one’s own racial/ethnic group. There are four, four-item subscales: Membership CSE, Public CSE, Private CSE, and Importance to Identity, however the IBelong study (Lee &amp; Neville, 2024) used a total scale score. An example item is, “The racial-ethnic group I belong to is an important reflection of who I am.” Because I was not able to locate factor loadings from a psychometric evaluation, I simulated the data by specifying a 0.8 as a standardized factor loading for each of the items on the general factor. The Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure – Revised [MEIMR; Brown et al. (2014)] is a 7-item scale. The first item is an open-ended question for identification of respondent ethnic group. The remaining six items are assessed with Likert scaling ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). There are two, three-item subscales which assess exploration (e.g., “I have spent time trying to find out more about my ethnic group, such as its history, tradition, and customs”) and commitment (“I have a strong sense of belonging to my own ethnic group.”) Higher scores indicate more positive ethnic identity. In the iBELONG study (Lee &amp; Neville, 2024), only a total MEIMR scale was used. My simulation used factor loadings from Brown et al. (2014) but treated them as a single scale. Because data is collected at the item level (and I want this resource to be as practical as possible, I have simulated the data for each of the scales at the item level. Simulating the data involved using factor loadings, means, and correlations between the scales. Because the simulation will produce “out-of-bounds” values, the code below re-scales the scores into the range of the Likert-type scaling and rounds them to whole values. #Entering the intercorrelations, means, and standard deviations from the journal article iBelong_generating_model &lt;- &#39; #measurement model Authenticity =~ .66*Auth1 + .64*Auth2 + .63*Auth3 + .58*Auth4 + .55*Auth5 Connection =~ .72*Conn1 + .60*Conn2 + .59*Conn3 + .58*Conn4 + .58*Conn5 Home =~ .64*Home1 + .63*Home2 + .57*Home3 + .57*Home4 + .53*Home5 RECthriving =~ .68*Thriv1 + .66*Thriv2 + .59*Thriv3 + .54*Thriv4 + .49*Thriv5 SelfDefinition =~ .82*Self1 + .65*Self2 + .65*Self3 + .54*Self4 + .49*Self5 GBS =~ .70*GBS1 + .67*GBS2 + .65*GBS5 + .67*GBS8 + .70*GBS10 + .78*GBS11 + .78*GBS3 + .66*GBS4 + .77*GBS6 + .82*GBS7 + .79*GBS9 + .66*GBS12 CSESR =~ .8*CSESR1 + .8*CSESR2 + .8*CSESR3 + .8*CSESR4 + .8*CSESR5 + .8*CSESR6 + .8*CSESR7 + .8*CSESR8 + .8*CSESR9 + .8*CSESR10 + .8*CSESR11 + .8*CSESR12 + .8*CSESR13 + .8*CSESR14 + .8*CSESR15 + .8*CSESR16 MEIMR =~ .60*MEIMR1 + .93*MEIMR4 + .81*MEIMR5 + .86*MEIMR2 + .84*MEIMR3 + .89*MEIMR6 #Means Authenticity ~ 4.30*1 Connection ~ 4.16*1 Home ~ 4.51*1 RECthriving ~ 4.81*1 SelfDefinition ~ 4.53*1 GBS ~ 4.84*1 CSESR ~ 5.15*1 MEIMR ~ 3.81*1 #Correlations Authenticity ~~ .73*Connection Authenticity ~~ .78*Home Authenticity ~~ .64*RECthriving Authenticity ~~ .52*SelfDefinition Authenticity ~~ .58*GBS Authenticity ~~ .58*CSESR Authenticity ~~ .48*MEIMR Connection ~~ .81*Home Connection ~~ .70*RECthriving Connection ~~ .43*SelfDefinition Connection ~~ .36*GBS Connection ~~ .63*CSESR Connection ~~ .62*MEIMR Home ~~ .74*RECthriving Home ~~ .48*SelfDefinition Home ~~ .51*GBS Home ~~ .65*CSESR Home ~~ .63*MEIMR RECthriving ~~ .46*SelfDefinition RECthriving ~~ .42*GBS RECthriving ~~ .70*CSESR RECthriving ~~ .70*MEIMR SelfDefinition ~~ .29*GBS SelfDefinition ~~ .38*CSESR SelfDefinition ~~ .35*MEIMR &#39; set.seed(240326) iBel &lt;- lavaan::simulateData(model = iBelong_generating_model, model.type = &quot;sem&quot;, meanstructure = T, sample.nobs=500, standardized=FALSE) #used to retrieve column indices used in the rescaling script below col_index &lt;- as.data.frame(colnames(iBel)) #The code below loops through each column of the dataframe and assigns the scaling accordingly #Rows 1 thru 25 are the iBelong scale #Rows 26 thru 37 are the General Belonging Scale #Rows 38 thru 53 are the Collective Self Esteem Scale Race Specific Version #Rows 54 thru 59 are the Multigroup Etnic Identity measure Revised for(i in 1:ncol(iBel)){ if(i &gt;= 1 &amp; i &lt;= 25){ iBel[,i] &lt;- scales::rescale(iBel[,i], c(1, 6)) } if(i &gt;= 26 &amp; i &lt;= 37){ iBel[,i] &lt;- scales::rescale(iBel[,i], c(1, 7)) } if(i &gt;= 38 &amp; i &lt;= 53){ iBel[,i] &lt;- scales::rescale(iBel[,i], c(1, 7)) } if(i &gt;= 54 &amp; i &lt;= 59){ iBel[,i] &lt;- scales::rescale(iBel[,i], c(1, 5)) } } #rounding to integers so that the data resembles that which was collected library(tidyverse) iBel &lt;- iBel %&gt;% round(0) #quick check of my work #psych::describe(iBel) The optional script below will let you save the simulated data to your computing environment as either an .rds object (preserves any formatting you might do) or a.csv file (think “Excel lite”). # to save the df as an .rds (think &#39;R object&#39;) file on your computer; # it should save in the same file as the .rmd file you are working # with saveRDS(iBel, &#39;iBel.rds&#39;) bring back the simulated dat from an # .rds file iBel &lt;- readRDS(&#39;iBel.rds&#39;) # write the simulated data as a .csv write.table(iBel, # file=&#39;iBel.csv&#39;, sep=&#39;,&#39;, col.names=TRUE, row.names=FALSE) bring # back the simulated dat from a .csv file iBel &lt;- # read.csv(&#39;iBel.csv&#39;, header = TRUE) Lessons in this volume teach test-retest reliability and invariance testing.

Items are written such that researchers can provide the focal identity (e.g., “a teacher,” “LGBTQ”). Across all three scales, higher scores reflect higher threat. It appears that the authors landed on a single-order, correlated factors, structure. Beneath each of the three factors are a list of the items. Variable names follow in parentheses. Identity Value: I feel that there is a negative value attached to my identity as [LGBTQ]. (Val1) Being [LGBTQ] is worth less in the eyes of others than before. (Val2) I feel that others attach a negative value to my identity as [LGBTQ]. (Val3) I feel that my identity as [LGBTQ] is devalued by others. (Val4) I feel that others see little value in my identity as [LGBTQ].(Val5) Identity Meaning: I am no longer sure what it means to be [LGBTQ].(Mng1) I am questioning what it means to be [LGBTQ]. (Mng2) I find myself questioning what it means to be [LGBTQ]. (Mng3) The core of what it means to be [LGBTQ] is changing in a way I do not like. (Mng4) What it means to be [LGBTQ] is changing in a way I do not like. (Mng5) What it means to be [LGBTQ] is being called into question. (Mng6) Being [LGBTQ] used to mean something different. (Mng7) -I feel that being [LGBTQ] does not mean the same thing anymore. (Mng8) Identity Enactment I am limited in my ability to express my identity as [LGBTQ]. (Enact1) I may no longer be able to engage in activities that express my identity as [LGBTQ]. (Enact2) I may no longer be able to show that I am [LGBTQ]. (Enact3) I worry about no longer being able to express my identity as [LGBTQ]. (Enacte4) I worry that I cannot behave in the way [an LGBTQ person] behaves. (Enact5) I worry that I cannot show people that I am [LGBTQ]. (Enact6) Although I have simulated data, the authors posted their data and codebooks from the different phases at the OSF respository. Additional materials are available as a supplement to the article. There were a number of scales utilized in this study. Because including them all caused problems of convergence, beyond the subscales in the focal measure, I have simulated data for only a few more. This will provide practice in evaluating convergent, discriminant, and incremental validity. Self-esteem was assessed with Rosenberg’s 10-item scale. Responses are measured on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly agree) to 4 (strongly disagree). Some items are reverse-coded. However, using the data from this simulation presumes that reverse-scoring has already been completed. Higher scores indicate higher self-esteem. An example item is “On the whole, I am satisfied with myself.” Factor loadings were obtained from Mullen et al. (2013). Identity suppression was assessed with 4 items from Madera et al.’s (2012) 10 item scale. It is a bit unclear, but it appears that items were rated on a 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree) scale with higher scores reflecting higher identity suppression. A sample item is, “I refrain from talking about my identity as LGBTQ at work.” Workplace microaggressions was captured with 11 items from Resnick and Galupo’s (Resnick &amp; Galupo, 2019) scale. Responses are measured on a Likert type scale ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (a great deal). Higher scores indicate higher frequency of microaggressions. An example item is “Having my behaviors mimicked in a joking way due to my LGBTQ identity.” It is unclear if they used one or more scales. I simulated the data from Resnick and Galupo, selecting 3 and 4 items from three subscales. Green behaviors was captured with three items from Norton et al.’s (Norton et al., 2017) scale. Responses are measured on a Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The response stem was, “Tomorrow, I intend to…” and items included, “…act in environmentally friendly ways,” “…carry out environmentally friendly behaviors at work,” and “…perform pro-environmental behaviors while at work. In the absence of factor loadings, I made them up. Because data is collected at the item level (and I want this resource to be as practical as possible, I have simulated the data for each of the scales at the item level. I guided the simulation using factor loadings from the exploratory factor analysis results and means and correlations from the Stage 5 analysis where 516 individuals who identified as LGBTQ completed the survey. Because the simulation will produce “out-of-bounds” values, the code below rescales the scores into the range of the Likert-type scaling and rounds them to whole values. #Entering the intercorrelations, means, and standard deviations from the journal article IdentityThreat_generating_model &lt;- &#39; #measurement model Value =~ .83*Val1 + .78*Val2 + .88*Val3 + .80*Val4 + .73*Val5 Meaning =~ .66*Mng1 + .81*Mng2 + .85*Mng3 + .78*Mng4 + .74*Mng5 + .64*Mng6 + .65*Mng7 + .73*Mng8 Enactment =~ .66*Enact1 + .64*Enact2 + .82*Enact3 + .70*Enact4 + .66*Enact5 + .94*Enact6 SelfEsteem =~ .95*SE1 + .98*SE2 + .66*SE3 + .81*SE4 + .55*SE5 + .80*SE6 + .75*SE7 + .66*SE8 + .78*SE9 + .76*SE10 IDsuppression =~ .78*IDs1 + .67*IDs2 + .82*IDs3 + .90*IDs4 WkplcMicroAgg =~ .84*Micro1 + .87*Micro2 + .72*Micro3 + .78*Micro4 + .67*Micro5 + .81*Micro6 + .63*Micro7 + .50*Micro8 + .58*Micro9 + .83*Micro10 + .63*Micro11 GreenBx =~ .77*G1 + .81*G2 + .83*G3 #Means Value ~ 2.15*1 Meaning ~ 2.10*1 Enactment ~ 2.17*1 SelfEsteem ~ 3.44*1 IDsuppression ~ 3.13*1 WkplcMicroAgg ~ 1.24*1 GreenBx ~ 3.49*1 #Correlations Value ~~ .58*Meaning Value ~~ .73*Enactment Value ~~ -.21*SelfEsteem Value ~~ .35*IDsuppression Value ~~ .41*WkplcMicroAgg Value ~~ -.09*GreenBx Meaning ~~ .60*Enactment Meaning ~~ .63*SelfEsteem Meaning ~~ .26*IDsuppression Meaning ~~ .24*WkplcMicroAgg Meaning ~~ -.08*GreenBx Enactment ~~ -.31*SelfEsteem Enactment ~~ .54*IDsuppression Enactment ~~ .24*WkplcMicroAgg Enactment ~~ -.06*GreenBx SelfEsteem ~~ -.24*IDsuppression SelfEsteem ~~ -.06*WkplcMicroAgg SelfEsteem ~~ .15*GreenBx IDsuppression ~~ .00*WkplcMicroAgg IDsuppression ~~ -.02*GreenBx &#39; set.seed(240330) IdThreat &lt;- lavaan::simulateData(model = IdentityThreat_generating_model, model.type = &quot;sem&quot;, meanstructure = T, sample.nobs=516, standardized=FALSE) #used to retrieve column indices used in the rescaling script below col_index &lt;- as.data.frame(colnames(IdThreat)) #The code below loops through each column of the dataframe and assigns the scaling accordingly #Rows 1 thru 19 are the Identity Threat #Rows 20 thru 29 are Self Esteem #Rows 30 thru 33 are Identity Suppression #Rows 34 thru 44 are Workplace Microaggessions #Rows 45 thru 47 are Green Behaviors for(i in 1:ncol(IdThreat)){ if(i &gt;= 1 &amp; i &lt;= 19){ IdThreat[,i] &lt;- scales::rescale(IdThreat[,i], c(1, 7)) } if(i &gt;= 20 &amp; i &lt;= 29){ IdThreat[,i] &lt;- scales::rescale(IdThreat[,i], c(1, 4)) } if(i &gt;= 30 &amp; i &lt;= 33){ IdThreat[,i] &lt;- scales::rescale(IdThreat[,i], c(1, 7)) } if(i &gt;= 34 &amp; i &lt;= 44){ IdThreat[,i] &lt;- scales::rescale(IdThreat[,i], c(1, 5)) } if(i &gt;= 45 &amp; i &lt;= 47){ IdThreat[,i] &lt;- scales::rescale(IdThreat[,i], c(1, 5)) } } #rounding to integers so that the data resembles that which was collected library(tidyverse) IdThreat &lt;- IdThreat %&gt;% round(0) #quick check of my work #psych::describe(IdThreat) The optional script below will let you save the simulated data to your computing environment as either an .rds object (preserves any formatting you might do) or a.csv file (think “Excel lite”). # to save the df as an .rds (think &#39;R object&#39;) file on your computer; # it should save in the same file as the .rmd file you are working # with saveRDS(IdThreat, &#39;IdThreat.rds&#39;) bring back the simulated dat # from an .rds file IdThreat &lt;- readRDS(&#39;IdThreat.rds&#39;) # write the simulated data as a .csv write.table(IdThreat, # file=&#39;IdThreat.csv&#39;, sep=&#39;,&#39;, col.names=TRUE, row.names=FALSE) # bring back the simulated dat from a .csv file IdThreat &lt;- # read.csv(&#39;IdThreat.csv&#39;, header = TRUE) Lessons in this volume teach test-retest reliability and invariance testing. In both of these circumstances, data from two different administrations of the focal test are required. For test-retest, these would be completed by the same person; for invariance-testing, these would be completed by different people. Below I have simulated two sets of data for The Identity Threat Scale (George et al., 2023). I have named them “A” and “B”.

The scale includes 21 items with responses rated on a 5 point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Higher scores indicate a greater anti-racist awareness and behavior. Beneath each of the five factors are a list of the items. Variable names follow in parentheses. Individual Advocacy: When I hear people telling racist jokes and using negative racial stereotypes, I usually confront them (Advoc1) I actively seek to understand how I participate in both intentional and unintentional racism (Advoc2) I actively seek to educate myself about the experience of racism (Advoc3) I interrupt racist conversations and jokes when I head my friends talking that way (Advoc4) I have challenged acts of racism that I have witnessed in my workplace or at school (Advoc5) I make it a point to educate myself about the experience of historically oppressed groups in the US (e.g. slavery, internment of Japanese, American Indians and the trail of tears etc.) (Advoc6) I often speak to my friends about the problem of racism in the US, and what we can do about it (Advoc7) I do not like to talk about racism in public (Advoc8) NEEDS REVERSING I interrupt racist conversations and jokes when I hear them in my family (Advoc9) Awareness of Racism: I feel guilty and ashamed when I think of the history of racism and slavery in the US (Aware1) It bothers me that my country has yet to acknowledge the impact of slavery (Aware2) The US should offer some type of payment to the descendants of slaves (Aware3) The US has not acknowledged the impact of slavery (Aware4) Because of racism in the US, Blacks do not have the same educational opportunities as compared to Whites (Aware5) Within the US, racism is largely perpetuated by the White racial majority (Aware6) The police unfairly target Black men and Latinos (Aware7) Institutional Advocacy I give money to organizations working against racism and discrimination (Inst1) When I read articles in newspapers or magazines that are perpetuating racist ideas, I generally write a letter to the editor (Inst2) I am actively involved in exposing companies that uphold exclusionary and racist practices (Inst3) I write letters to local and state politicians to voice my concerns about racism (Inst4) I volunteer with anti-racist or racial justice organizations (Inst5) This article was published in the open access Journal for Social Action in Counseling and Psychology and is available at its website. Below is the script for simulating item-level data from the factor loadings, means, and sample size presented in the published article. Four additional scales were reported in the Pieterse et al. (2022) article. Unfortunately, I could not locate factor loadings for all of them; in these cases I uniformly assigned the factor loading of 0.8. The scales, their original citation, and information about how I simulated data for each are listed below. White Privilege was assessed using a 13-item subscale from The Privilege and Oppression Inventory** (Hays et al., 2007). Items are rated on a Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree). An example item is, “Whites have the power to exclude other groups.” Higher scores indicate greater levels of White privilege. Color Blind Racial Attitudes (Neville et al., 2000) is a 21-item scale that assesses implicit racism-related attitudes. The 21 items are assessed on a Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5 with higher scores reflecting greater levels of color-blind racial attitudes. I was able to simulate two of the three subscales of the instrument: Racial Privilege (RP) and Blatant Racial Issues (BR). Because data is collected at the item level (and I want this resource to be as practical as possible, I have simulated the data for each of the scales at the item level. Simulating the data involved using factor loadings, means, and correlations between the scales. Where possible, factor loadings are retrieved from original (or replication) articles that report on their psychometric evaluation. The means and correlations are from Pietierse et al. (Pieterse et al., 2022) Because the simulation will produce “out-of-bounds” values, the code below rescales the scores into the range of the Likert-type scaling and rounds them to whole values. #Entering the intercorrelations, means, and standard deviations from the journal article Antiracism_generating_model &lt;- &#39; #measurement model ARBI =~ .274*Advoc1 + .699*Advoc2 + .752*Advoc3 + .465*Advoc4 + .479*Advoc5 + .617*Advoc6 + .672*Advoc7 + .455*Advoc8 + .420*Advoc9 + .135*Aware1 + .568*Aware2 + .627*Aware3 + .566*Aware4 + .660*Aware5 + .513*Aware6 + .565*Aware7 + .536*Inst1 + .116*Inst2 + .408*Inst3 + .295*Inst4 + .638*Inst5 Advocacy =~ .618*Advoc1 + .055*Advoc2 + .035*Advoc3 + .712*Advoc4 + .275*Advoc5 + .124*Advoc6 + .090*Advoc7 + -.250*Advoc8 + .623*Advoc9 Awareness =~ .211*Aware1 + .669*Aware2 + .428*Aware3 + .692*Aware4 + .445*Aware5 + .505*Aware6 + .528*Aware7 Institutional =~ .381*Inst1 + .547*Inst2 + .648*Inst3 + .618*Inst4 + .392*Inst5 WhitePriv =~ .80*WP1 + .59*WP2 + .62*WP3 + .65*WP4 + .80*WP5 + .50*WP6 + .78*WP7 + .57*WP8 + .64*WP9 + .49*WP10 + .64*WP11 + .61*WP12 + .40*WP13 CoBRAS_RP =~ .68*RP1 + .66*RP2 + .64*RP3 + .62*RP4 + .62*RP5 + .58*RP6 + .54*RP7 CoBRAS_BR =~ .77*BR1 + .67*BR2 + .65*BR3 + .65*BR4 + .62*BR5 + .55*BR6 + .48*BR7 #Means ARBI ~ 3.91*1 Advocacy ~5.33*1 Awareness ~ 4.26*1 Institutional ~ 1.66*1 WhitePriv ~ 5.20*1 CoBRAS_RP ~ 2.54*1 CoBRAS_BR ~ 1.65*1 #Correlations ARBI ~~ .78*Awareness ARBI ~~ .87*Advocacy ARBI ~~ .75*Institutional ARBI ~~ .64*WhitePriv ARBI ~~ -.65*CoBRAS_RP ARBI ~~ -.60*CoBRAS_BR Awareness ~~ .50*Advocacy Awareness ~~ .34*Institutional Awareness ~~ .81*WhitePriv Awareness ~~ -.78*CoBRAS_RP Awareness ~~ -.62*CoBRAS_BR Advocacy ~~ .55*Institutional Advocacy ~~ .43*WhitePriv Advocacy ~~ -.45*CoBRAS_RP Advocacy ~~ -.46*CoBRAS_BR Institutional ~~ .27*WhitePriv Institutional ~~ -.31*CoBRAS_RP Institutional ~~ -.34*CoBRAS_BR WhitePriv ~~ -.85*CoBRAS_RP WhitePriv ~~ -.6*CoBRAS_BR CoBRAS_RP ~~ .60*CoBRAS_BR &#39; set.seed(240218) AntiR &lt;- lavaan::simulateData(model = Antiracism_generating_model, model.type = &quot;sem&quot;, meanstructure = T, sample.nobs=153, standardized=FALSE) #used to retrieve column indices used in the rescaling script below col_index &lt;- as.data.frame(colnames(AntiR)) #The code below loops through each column of the dataframe and assigns the scaling accordingly #Rows 1 thru 21 are the ARBI #Rows 22 thru 34 are the White Privilege Scale #Rows 35 thru 48 are the CoBRAS for(i in 1:ncol(AntiR)){ if(i &gt;= 1 &amp; i &lt;= 21){ AntiR[,i] &lt;- scales::rescale(AntiR[,i], c(1, 5)) } if(i &gt;= 22 &amp; i &lt;= 34){ AntiR[,i] &lt;- scales::rescale(AntiR[,i], c(1, 6)) } if(i &gt;= 35 &amp; i &lt;= 48){ AntiR[,i] &lt;- scales::rescale(AntiR[,i], c(1, 5)) } } #rounding to integers so that the data resembles that which was collected library(tidyverse) AntiR &lt;- AntiR %&gt;% round(0) #quick check of my work #psych::describe(AntiR) #Reversing the supportive item on the Perceptions of LGBTQ Campus Climate Scale so that the exercises will be consistent with the format in which the data was collected The optional script below will let you save the simulated data to your computing environment as either an .rds object (preserves any formatting you might do) or a.csv file (think “Excel lite”). # to save the df as an .rds (think &#39;R object&#39;) file on your computer; # it should save in the same file as the .rmd file you are working # with saveRDS(AntiR, &#39;AntiR.rds&#39;) bring back the simulated dat from # an .rds file AntiR &lt;- readRDS(&#39;AntiR.rds&#39;) # write the simulated data as a .csv write.table(AntiR, # file=&#39;AntiR.csv&#39;, sep=&#39;,&#39;, col.names=TRUE, row.names=FALSE) bring # back the simulated dat from a .csv file AntiR &lt;- # read.csv(&#39;AntiR.csv&#39;, header = TRUE) Lessons in this volume teach test-retest reliability and invariance testing.
